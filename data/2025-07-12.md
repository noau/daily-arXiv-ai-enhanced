### [1] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成全景图像拼接的方法，通过微调基于扩散的修复模型，实现在多个参考图像中合成无缝且视觉一致的全景图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接方法在处理视差效应、光照变化和相机设置差异时容易产生伪影，而现有生成模型在大范围全景内容合成上表现不佳。

Method: 提出一种方法，通过微调基于扩散的修复模型，以保留场景内容和布局，并基于单个参考图像生成完整的全景。

Result: 在捕获的数据集上评估，该方法在图像质量和场景一致性方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成无缝且视觉一致的全景图像，有效解决了传统方法和现有生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

### [2] [LangSplatV2: High-dimensional 3D Language Gaussian Splatting with 450+ FPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07136)
*Wanhua Li,Yujie Zhao,Minghan Qin,Yang Liu,Yuanhao Cai,Chuang Gan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LangSplatV2通过高维特征溅射和3D开放词汇文本查询，显著提升了速度和查询精度，克服了LangSplat在实时推理性能上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LangSplat在3D语言场中表现出色，但实时推理性能不足（8.2 FPS），限制了其广泛应用，因此开发了LangSplatV2以解决这一问题。

Method: LangSplatV2将每个高斯视为全局字典中的稀疏代码，学习3D稀疏系数场，消除了重型解码器的需求，并通过CUDA优化实现了高效稀疏系数溅射。

Result: LangSplatV2在476.2 FPS和384.6 FPS下运行，分别比LangSplat快42倍和47倍，同时提高了查询精度。

Conclusion: LangSplatV2不仅显著提升了速度和精度，还通过高效的方法解决了实时推理的瓶颈，为3D语言场的应用提供了强大支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional
feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6
FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 $\times$ speedup and a 47
$\times$ boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.
LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into
3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with
SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for
applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,
LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even
with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this
paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the
heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2
assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary,
leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely
eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we
further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA
optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while
incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or
competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster. Codes and demos
are available at our project page: https://langsplat-v2.github.io.

### [4] [Self-supervised Learning of Latent Space Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07440)
*Yue Li,Gene Wei-Chin Lin,Egor Larionov,Aljaz Bozic,Doug Roble,Ladislav Kavan,Stelian Coros,Bernhard Thomaszewski,Tuur Stuyck,Hsiao-yu Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经潜在空间积分器的新型子空间模拟框架，适用于便携设备，通过自监督学习提高推理稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟方法计算成本高，子空间方法虽能提高性能，但仍难以满足便携设备的严格性能需求，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入神经潜在空间积分器的子空间模拟框架，完全在潜在空间内操作，避免了全空间计算，并通过自监督学习优化推理过程。

Result: 在涉及杆、壳和固体等复杂示例中，该方法表现出高效性和多功能性，适合便携设备部署。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了模拟效率，为便携设备上的动态行为建模提供了可行的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamic behavior of deformable objects is crucial for creating
realistic digital worlds. While conventional simulations produce high-quality
motions, their computational costs are often prohibitive. Subspace simulation
techniques address this challenge by restricting deformations to a
lower-dimensional space, improving performance while maintaining visually
compelling results. However, even subspace methods struggle to meet the
stringent performance demands of portable devices such as virtual reality
headsets and mobile platforms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel subspace simulation framework powered by a neural latent-space
integrator. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to enhance
inference stability and generalization. By operating entirely within latent
space, our method eliminates the need for full-space computations, resulting in
a highly efficient method well-suited for deployment on portable devices. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging examples involving
rods, shells, and solids, showcasing its versatility and potential for
widespread adoption.

### [5] [SD-GS: Structured Deformable 3D Gaussians for Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07465)
*Wei Yao,Shuzhao Xie,Letian Li,Weixiang Zhang,Zhixin Lai,Shiqi Dai,Ke Zhang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑高效的动态高斯框架SD-GS，通过可变形锚点网格和变形感知的密集化策略，显著降低存储成本并提升动态场景重建的视觉质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯框架在动态场景重建中存在存储成本与复杂运动表征能力之间的固有权衡，限制了其实际应用。

Method: SD-GS框架引入可变形锚点网格作为分层高效场景表示，并通过变形感知密集化策略动态调整锚点分布，优化复杂运动的建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，SD-GS相比现有方法平均减少60%模型大小，提升100%帧率，同时保持或提升视觉质量。

Conclusion: SD-GS通过创新设计显著提升了动态场景重建的效率和效果，解决了现有方法的局限。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

### [6] [Capture Stage Environments: A Guide to Better Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07623)
*Hannah Dröge,Janelle Pfeifer,Saskia Rabich,Markus Plack,Reinhard Klein,Matthias B. Hullin*

Main category: cs.GR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有图像抠图算法在高录制场景中的表现不佳，论文旨在分享这些挑战并提供一个改进的工作流程指南。

Result: 展示了一种无需大量标注即可适应复杂录制场景的方法，并通过验证方法证明了其优势。

Conclusion: 论文为实践者提供了一个改进的图像抠图工作流程，并验证了其在复杂录制场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

### [7] [RTR-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering with Radiance Transfer and Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07733)
*Yongyang Zhou,Fang-Lue Zhang,Zichen Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RTR-GS 是一个新颖的反向渲染框架，通过结合正向和延迟渲染来分解BRDF和光照，有效渲染具有任意反射属性的物体，提供可信的重光照结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在新视角合成中表现优异，但渲染反射物体仍然是一个重大挑战，尤其是在反向渲染和重光照方面。

Method: RTR-GS采用混合渲染模型，结合正向渲染和延迟渲染，有效恢复几何结构并分解BRDF和光照，同时通过额外的基于物理的延迟渲染分支进一步优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在新视角合成、法线估计、BRDF和光照分解以及重光照方面表现优异，同时保持了高效的训练和推理过程。

Conclusion: RTR-GS成功解决了反射物体的渲染问题，提供了高质量的分解和重光照结果，为相关领域的研究提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

### [8] [Hi-d maps: An interactive visualization technique for multi-dimensional categorical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07890)
*Radi Muhammad Reza,Benjamin A Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Hi-D maps是一种新颖的多维分类数据可视化方法，通过2D多边形区域和多种视觉线索实现高效的空间利用和信息展示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够有效且空间高效地可视化大量数据维度的技术，Hi-D maps旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将完整数据空间映射到2D多边形区域，通过平行于用户控制顺序的边线进行分层切割，并利用多种视觉线索（如方向、厚度、颜色、可计数标记和文本）展示跨维度信息。

Result: Hi-D maps提供了交互性和分层浏览功能，便于灵活探索数据细节，同时标记动画增加了交互时的视觉吸引力。尽管在维度过多时会降低效果，但在达到感知极限前可能增加清晰度。

Conclusion: Hi-D maps为多维分类数据提供了一种有效的可视化方法，具有交互性和分层浏览的扩展能力，尤其在维度数量适中时效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Hi-D maps, a novel method for the visualization of
multi-dimensional categorical data. Our work addresses the scarcity of
techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective
and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D
regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel
to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension.
We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color,
countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have
added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible
exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus,
our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our
glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many
visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of
dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before
those limits are reached.

### [9] [On Propositional Program Equivalence (extended abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07480)
*Tobias Kappé*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文讨论了命题程序等价性的最新进展，重点是从(Guarded) Kleene代数与测试（(G)KAT）的角度进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于解决程序等价性问题，虽然通用程序等价性是不可判定的，但通过抽象语句的语义，这一问题变得可判定且实际可行。

Method: 方法是通过(Guarded) Kleene代数与测试（(G)KAT）的理论框架来分析命题程序等价性。

Result: 结果表明命题程序等价性在抽象语义的情况下是可判定的，并且可以通过(G)KAT框架进行有效分析。

Conclusion: 结论指出命题程序等价性在抽象语义的情况下具有可行性，且(G)KAT为这一问题的研究提供了有力的理论工具。

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

*Yang Li,Yuchao Ma,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化的联合广告机制，包括单广告位的最优机制和多广告位的神经网络方法BundleNet，显著提升了平台收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合广告机制未能实现最优分配和收入最大化，主要因为它们关注单个广告主而忽略了广告组合结构。

Method: 在单广告位设置中提出最优机制；在多广告位设置中设计了基于神经网络的BundleNet方法。

Result: 实验表明，BundleNet生成的机制在单广告位中近似理论最优结果，在多广告位中表现优异，显著提升了收入并满足激励兼容性和个体理性。

Conclusion: BundleNet是一种高效的联合广告机制，适用于多广告位场景，为平台提供了显著的收入增长和理论保障。

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

### [11] [Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Assumed Bid Cost Reverse Auction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07688)
*Jowa Yangchin,Ningrinla Marchang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RA-ABC的新方法，允许用户在收集数据前出价，并通过动态用户招募扩展RA-ABCDR，显著提升系统性能和用户保留率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动群智感知系统中，用户通过逆向竞拍框架提交数据，但传统方法可能导致资源浪费。研究旨在优化系统效用，减少资源消耗。

Method: 提出RA-ABC方法，让用户在收集数据前出价，减少任务执行浪费；进一步扩展为RA-ABCDR，支持动态用户加入竞拍。

Result: RA-ABC和RA-ABCDR优于传统方法，RA-ABCDR用户保留率提高54.6%，拍卖成本降低22.2%，系统效率和可持续性显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态用户招募显著优化系统性能，RA-ABCDR在稳定性、公平性和成本效益方面表现优异，为MCS系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is the mechanism wherein people can contribute in
data collection process using their own mobile devices which have sensing
capabilities. Incentives are rewards that individuals get in exchange for data
they submit. Reverse Auction Bidding (RAB) is a framework that allows users to
place bids for selling the data they collected. Task providers can select users
to buy data from by looking at bids. Using the RAB framework, MCS system can be
optimized for better user utility, task provider utility and platform utility.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Reverse Auction with Assumed
Bid Cost (RA-ABC) which allows users to place a bid in the system before
collecting data. We opine that performing the tasks only after winning helps in
reducing resource consumption instead of performing the tasks before bidding.
User Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated with which they decide to further
participate or not by either increasing or decreasing their bids. We also
propose an extension of RA-ABC with dynamic recruitment (RA-ABCDR) in which we
allow new users to join the system at any time during bidding rounds.
Simulation results demonstrate that RA-ABC and RA-ABCDR outperform the widely
used Tullock Optimal Prize Function, with RA-ABCDR achieving up to 54.6\%
higher user retention and reducing auction cost by 22.2\%, thereby ensuring
more efficient and sustainable system performance. Extensive simulations
confirm that dynamic user recruitment significantly enhances performance across
stability, fairness, and cost-efficiency metrics.

*Zhen Zhang,Weian Li,Yuhan Wang,Qi Qi,Kun Huang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"混合广告"的新模型，通过结合独立商店和捆绑广告来提高广告的通用性和点击率，并通过混合遗憾网络优化拍卖机制，显著提升了平台收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告模型和联合广告模型分别吸引不同的用户群体，导致点击率低，为了解决这一限制并提高通用性，提出了混合广告模型。

Method: 提出混合广告模型，每个广告位可以分配给独立商店或捆绑广告，并设计混合遗憾网络（HRegNet）来优化拍卖机制。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的大量实验表明，HRegNet生成的机制显著提高了平台收入，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 混合广告模型及其优化机制HRegNet在提升广告效果和平台收入方面表现出色，为广告模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Online advertisements are a primary revenue source for e-commerce platforms.
Traditional advertising models are store-centric, selecting winning stores
through auction mechanisms. Recently, a new approach known as joint advertising
has emerged, which presents sponsored bundles combining one store and one brand
in ad slots. Unlike traditional models, joint advertising allows platforms to
collect payments from both brands and stores. However, each of these two
advertising models appeals to distinct user groups, leading to low
click-through rates when users encounter an undesirable advertising model. To
address this limitation and enhance generality, we propose a novel advertising
model called ''Hybrid Advertising''. In this model, each ad slot can be
allocated to either an independent store or a bundle. To find the optimal
auction mechanisms in hybrid advertising, while ensuring nearly dominant
strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality, we introduce the
Hybrid Regret Network (HRegNet), a neural network architecture designed for
this purpose. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data
demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by HRegNet significantly improve
platform revenue compared to established baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何利用机器学习预测来设计协调机制，以减少自私行为对并行链路网络拥塞游戏的影响。

Method: 通过增强协调机制，引入简单的输入速率建议，分析其对单调成本函数的统一影响，并提出一种具有误差容忍性的机制。

Conclusion: 通过研究，证明了建议机制在一致性和稳健性方面的优势，并为单调成本函数提供了完整的特征描述，表明其在预测误差范围内的最优表现。

Abstract: We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine
cost functions. We investigate the power of machine-learned predictions in the
design of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of
selfishness. Our main results demonstrate that enhancing coordination
mechanisms with a simple advice on the input rate can optimize the social cost
whenever the advice is accurate (consistency), while only incurring minimal
losses even when the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate (bounded
robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent
mechanisms that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our
suggested mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness. We further
explore the notion of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism
to achieve error-tolerance, i.e. we provide an approximation guarantee that
degrades smoothly as a function of the prediction error, up to a predetermined
threshold, while achieving a bounded robustness.
