Conclusion: 选择性调制RoPE频率带的方法能够促进有效的风格对齐生成，避免复制参考内容，同时保留风格特征。

Abstract: Positional encodings are essential to transformer-based generative models, yet their behavior in multimodal and attention-sharing settings is not fully understood. In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.

Conclusion: Gabor Fields为高斯表示提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，不仅解决了传统问题，还为体渲染的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Gaussian-based representations have enabled efficient physically-based volume rendering at a fraction of the memory cost of regular, discrete, voxel-based distributions. However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians.

Abstract: In this work, we present a memory-efficient, high-performance GPU framework for moment-based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) with fluid-solid coupling. We introduce a split-kernel scheme that decouples fluid updates from solid boundary handling, substantially reducing warp divergence and improving utilization on GPUs. We further perform the first von Neumann stability analysis of the high-order moment-encoded LBM (HOME-LBM) formulation, characterizing its spectral behavior and deriving stability bounds for individual moment components. These theoretical insights directly guide a practical 16-bit moment quantization without compromising numerical stability. Our framework achieves up to 6x speedup and reduces GPU memory footprint by up to 50% in fluid-only scenarios and 25% in scenes with complex solid boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art LBM solver, while preserving physical fidelity across a range of large-scale benchmarks and real-time demonstrations. The proposed approach enables scalable, stable, and high-resolution LBM simulation on a single GPU, bridging theoretical stability analysis with practical GPU algorithm design.

### [4] [Monte Carlo Rendering to Diffusion Curves with Differential BEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05492)

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从蒙特卡罗渲染器生成的噪声样本中生成矢量图形（扩散曲线）的方法，填补了直接从3D几何中提取可编辑矢量图像的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然有通过蒙特卡罗光线追踪从3D几何生成栅格图像的常见方法，但缺乏直接从中提取带有着色信息的可编辑矢量图像的实用方法。

Method: 该方法将问题转化为对扩散曲线手柄的几何和颜色的随机优化问题，并使用Levenberg-Marquardt算法求解，核心是一种新颖的微分边界元方法（BEM）框架。

Result: 该方法在面对几何挑战性场景（如交叉扩散曲线）和目标图像的颜色噪声时表现出鲁棒性，无需干净输入图像即可直接使用噪声样本。

Conclusion: 本文展示了该方法在多种测试用例中的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，并提出了理论和应用中尚未解决的问题。

Abstract: We present a method for generating vector graphics, in the form of diffusion curves, directly from noisy samples produced by a Monte Carlo renderer. While generating raster images from 3D geometry via Monte Carlo raytracing is commonplace, there is no corresponding practical approach for robustly and directly extracting editable vector images with shading information from 3D geometry. To fill this gap, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem over the space of geometries and colors of diffusion curve handles, and solve it with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. At the core of our method is a novel differential boundary element method (BEM) framework that reconstructs colors from diffusion curve handles and computes gradients with respect to their parameters, requiring the expensive matrix factorization only once at the beginning of the optimization. Unlike triangulation-based techniques that require a clean domain decomposition, our method is robust to geometrically challenging scenarios, such as intersecting diffusion curves, and to color noise in the target image, enabling the direct use of noisy Monte Carlo samples without requiring a converged, error-free input image. We demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach across several test cases. Finally, we highlight several open questions raised by our work, which spans both theory and applications.

### [5] [Doc2Spec: Synthesizing Formal Programming Specifications from Natural Language via Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04892)
*Shihao Xia,Mengting He,Haomin Jia,Linhai Song*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Doc2Spec是一个多智能体框架，利用LLM从自然语言规则自动推导出规范语法，并生成形式化规范，显著提升了规范生成的可靠性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保API实现和使用符合自然语言编程规则对软件正确性、安全性和可靠性至关重要，但手动编写精确的形式化规范成本高昂且困难。

Method: Doc2Spec通过多智能体框架利用LLM从自然语言规则自动推导出规范语法，并基于该语法生成形式化规范，语法捕获领域知识并约束规范空间以提升一致性。

Result: 在三个编程语言的七个基准测试中，Doc2Spec优于无语法推导的基线方法，并与手动构建语法的技术表现相当，证明自动语法推导的有效性。

Conclusion: Doc2Spec通过自动化语法推导为形式化自然语言规则提供了一种高效且可靠的方法，显著降低了规范编写的成本并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Ensuring that API implementations and usage comply with natural language programming rules is critical for software correctness, security, and reliability. Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules.

### [6] [Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528)
*Danel Ahman,Ilja Sobolev*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Ahman和Pretnar提出的异步效应核心演算的规范化性质，证明在移除一般递归后剩余演算（包括顺序和并行部分）是强规范化的，并在重新引入受控中断驱动递归行为时，顺序部分仍保持强规范化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代数计算效应的同步处理缺乏异步性，Ahman和Pretnar的异步效应通过分离操作调用的执行和中断处理提供了异步性。该论文旨在研究这一核心演算的规范化性质，扩展其适用性。

Method: 论文通过移除一般递归并引入受控中断驱动递归行为，研究了核心演算的顺序和并行部分的强规范化性质，并结合Lindley和Stark的$\top\top$-lifting方法进行结构化证明。

Result: 证明移除一般递归后核心演算（包括顺序和并行部分）是强规范化的，并且在顺序部分重新引入受控中断驱动递归行为时仍保持强规范化。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了异步效应核心演算的理论基础，还为其在实际应用（如可取消远程调用和多线程）中的使用提供了理论支持，所有结果均在Agda中形式化验证。

Abstract: Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.

### [7] [An Equational Axiomatization of Dynamic Threads via Algebraic Effects: Presheaves on Finite Relations, Labelled Posets, and Parameterized Algebraic Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05850)
*Ohad Kammar,Jack Liell-Cock,Sam Lindley,Cristina Matache,Sam Staton*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 基于代数效应理论，本文为动态线程提供了完整的等式公理化方法，通过参数化代数理论和基本原语`fork`和`wait`，实现了对并发行为的完整建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态线程的并发行为需要一种简洁且完整的数学描述方法，代数效应理论为此提供了理论基础。

Method: 采用参数化代数理论构建动态线程的语法和语义，核心原语为`fork`和`wait`，并通过代数操作和定律（如`fork`的结合性）实现完整公理化。

Result: 等式公理化在两种意义上完整：闭表达式完全捕获了标记偏序集（pomsets）的相等性；开表达式在所有闭合替换下相等时证明相等。

Conclusion: 代数效应方法使得语义分析可聚焦于`fork`和`wait`的操作，进一步扩展为简单并发语言的语义，证明了其合理性、充分性和一阶完全抽象性。

Abstract: We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种数据驱动的结构简化方法，用于动态游戏的均衡计算，通过离线编译的最佳响应映射消除嵌套优化层和导数耦合，从而简化计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态游戏中计算纳什均衡的复杂性来自紧密耦合的最优性条件、嵌套优化结构和不良数值条件。现有方法要么需要显式建模所有代理的目标函数和约束，要么通过预测或策略近似解耦代理，牺牲均衡一致性。

Method: 提出了一种数据驱动的结构简化方法，将游戏的均衡计算重新结构化，通过嵌入离线编译的最佳响应映射作为可行性约束，消除嵌套优化层和导数耦合。

Result: 在标准正则条件下，当最佳响应算子准确时，简化问题的任何收敛解对应于原始游戏的局部开环纳什均衡；使用学习代理时，解在最佳响应近似误差范围内近似均衡一致。通过大规模蒙特卡罗实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过数据驱动的结构简化方法，显著降低了动态游戏均衡计算的复杂度，并在自主赛车问题中验证了其优于现有求解器的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic games are powerful tools to model multi-agent decision-making, yet computing Nash (generalized Nash) equilibria remains a central challenge in such settings. Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction.

### [9] [A Stronger Benchmark for Online Bilateral Trade: From Fixed Prices to Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05681)
*Anna Lunghi,Mattia Piccinato,Matteo Castiglioni,Alberto Marchesi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线双边贸易中的学习算法，提出了在全局预算平衡（GBB）约束下实现次线性遗憾的首个算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在全局预算平衡（GBB）约束下如何提高贸易增益（GFT），并解决现有弱预算平衡（WBB）算法在此情境下的局限性。

Method: 论文提出了一种在随机环境下基于一位反馈的算法，能够在估值分布具有有界密度的情况下实现$ackslashackslashwidetilde{ackslashackslashmathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$的遗憾。

Result: 研究结果表明，学习最优GBB价格对分布的问题在学习难度上与学习最优WBB价格的一维问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: 论文的结论指出，GBB约束可以有效提升贸易增益，且新算法在此约束下实现了显著改进。

Abstract: We study online bilateral trade, where a learner facilitates repeated exchanges between a buyer and a seller to maximize the Gain From Trade (GFT), i.e., the social welfare. In doing so, the learner must guarantee not to subsidize the market. This constraint is usually imposed per round through Weak Budget Balance (WBB). Despite that, Bernasconi et al. [2024] show that a Global Budget Balance (GBB) constraint on the profit -- enforced over the entire time horizon -- can improve the GFT by a multiplicative factor of two. While this might appear to be a marginal relaxation, this implies that all existing WBB-focused algorithms suffer linear regret when measured against the GBB optimum. In this work, we provide the first algorithm to achieve sublinear regret against the GBB benchmark in stochastic environments under one-bit feedback. In particular, we show that when the joint distribution of valuations has a bounded density, our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret. Our result shows that there is no separation between the one-dimensional problem of learning the optimal WBB price and the two-dimensional problem of learning the optimal GBB distribution over pairs of prices.

### [10] [Bandit Social Learning with Exploration Episodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05835)
*Kiarash Banihashem,Natalie Collina,Aleksandrs Slivkins*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了自利代理人在多臂老虎机协议下的社会学习动态，发现即使代理人在各自片段内探索积极性高，整体探索仍会失败，贝叶斯遗憾随时间线性增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解自利代理人在多臂老虎机协议下的集体行为，尤其关注其在AI交互或市场购物等重复决策场景中的探索行为。

Method: 方法是通过设定代理人的每个片段为一系列连续决策，分析其在片段内的高探索性与整体探索失败的关系。

Result: 结果表明，尽管代理人个体在片段内探索积极性高，但整体探索仍然失败，贝叶斯遗憾随时间线性增长，且这种现象并非最坏情况而是典型情况。

Conclusion: 结论是即使代理人存在片段内的有机探索，仍需要外部驱动的探索来解决整体探索失败的问题。

Abstract: We study a stylized social learning dynamics where self-interested agents collectively follow a simple multi-armed bandit protocol. Each agent controls an ``episode": a short sequence of consecutive decisions. Motivating applications include users repeatedly interacting with an AI, or repeatedly shopping at a marketplace. While agents are incentivized to explore within their respective episodes, we show that the aggregate exploration fails: e.g., its Bayesian regret grows linearly over time. In fact, such failure is a (very) typical case, not just a worst-case scenario. This conclusion persists even if an agent's per-episode utility is some fixed function of the per-round outcomes: e.g., $\min$ or $\max$, not just the sum. Thus, externally driven exploration is needed even when some amount of exploration happens organically.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了避免为所有可能联盟定义指数级多效用的计算复杂性，研究扩展了现有的简洁表示Hedonic游戏模型，提出了基于类型值差异的新模型，适用于描述运动员训练组或政治选民分组等自然场景。

Method: 研究者提出了一种新的Hedonic游戏变体，其中代理人的成本基于其类型值与联盟内其他成员值的差异，并通过距离阈值、最大值或平均值差异等定义成本。研究了这些设定下稳定联盟结构的存在性、性质及质量（价格和稳定性）。

Conclusion: 尽管模型设定简单（线性度量距离），但展示了丰富的模型景观，稳定联盟结构的存在性得以确认，但其具体表现因设定而异。

Abstract: Hedonic games are fundamental models for investigating the formation of coalitions among a set of strategic agents, where every agent has a certain utility for every possible coalition of agents it can be part of. To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.
  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely.
