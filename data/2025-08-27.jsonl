However, it is unclear how effective\nLLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two\nmature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the\nsame source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform\ngreat on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform\ndifferently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate\nconcise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but\ncan also make odd mistakes."}

An ``allocation facilitator''\naims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by\nencouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the\nsame time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.\nAdditionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.\n`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to\nrelax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an\noptimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned\nconstraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal\ndefinition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the\nfacilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees\nand also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial\nalgorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization\nproblems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We\ndemonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the\nimplications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive\nexperimentation on three real-world datasets."}

Unlike text-to-motion generation,\nsingle-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of\nexisting motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive\nretraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a\ncontrollable framework for blending two or more motions within a single\ngenerative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion\nblending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning\nthe generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization\nmechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven\ncontrol over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic\nskeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and\ncontrollable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner."}

However, integrating these technologies\npresents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require\nmultiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while\nradiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this\npaper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance\nfield rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of\nradiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and\nSparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane\nsweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The\nframework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and\navoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time\ninteractive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p\nacross 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard\nbenchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently\nrendering each view, while preserving image quality."}

We introduce PanoHair, a\nmodel that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge\ndistillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.\nOur approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D\norientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our\nmethod is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space\nmanipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to\ninfer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a\nstreamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups.

In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that\nsignificantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC\nwithout sacrificing visual fidelity.
