Drawing from classic\nlocal-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel\nneural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a\nlocal-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary\nmechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply\nlearned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then\nsolve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface\nglobally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full\nfrequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining\nagnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far\nless compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --\nboth in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.\nThese qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to\nprevious intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on\nsemantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.\nFinally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn\ndeformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that\nlearn on surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "PoissonNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u3001\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002PoissonNet\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "PoissonNet\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u6cca\u677e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5bf9\u7f51\u683c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "result": "PoissonNet\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u52a8\u753b\u8868\u9762\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "PoissonNet\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Service Providers (SPs) however\nalso have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a\nco-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form\nthe so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of\nsharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes\nfrom the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a\nnovel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game\ntheory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the\ngrand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the\npresence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be\ntoo conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which\npayoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for\nco-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where\ncomputational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a\ntelecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the\nprobability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and\nthe investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of\nuncertainty.

While\nthis approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an\nimportant role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems\nin an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional\napportionment with no information about the future.

An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed\nnumber of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional\nshare rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to\neach party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.\n  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For\ndeterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that\nyield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the\nseats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is\nbest possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a\nmethod guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party\nup to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)\nexists if and only if $n\\leq 3$.

Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and\nup to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,\nthen it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve\nby jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally\nuniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,\nwe show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior\nfor the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model\nindividual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around\nstrict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,\nindividually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to\ncollective rationality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u5300\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5c06\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u96c6\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u5300\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u5747\u8861\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u5e73\u6ed1\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5747\u8861\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u5f31\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5c40\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5219\u5177\u6709\u5f31\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u5e73\u6ed1\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u9644\u8fd1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u96c6\u4f53\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u5747\u8861\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}
