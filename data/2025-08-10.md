### [1] [Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825)
*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Voost的统一框架，通过联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，利用单一扩散变换器实现高质量的图像合成，并在多个基准测试中取得最佳效果。


<details>

Conclusion: Voost通过联合学习任务和创新的推理技术，成功解决了虚拟试穿中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

### [2] [Perceive-Sample-Compress: Towards Real-Time 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04965)
*Zijian Wang,Beizhen Zhao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种感知-采样-压缩框架，用于改进3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在大规模场景管理和存储效率上的不足，通过场景感知补偿算法和金字塔采样表示，结合广义高斯混合模型压缩算法，显著提升了内存效率和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法在处理大规模场景或资源受限时表现不佳，需要改进其管理和存储效率。

Method: 提出了感知-采样-压缩框架，包括场景感知补偿算法、金字塔采样表示和广义高斯混合模型压缩算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了内存效率和视觉质量，同时保持了实时渲染速度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D高斯泼溅在大规模场景管理和存储上的不足，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

### [3] [Laplacian Analysis Meets Dynamics Modelling: Gaussian Splatting for 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04966)
*Yifan Zhou,Beizhen Zhao,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合显式-隐式函数的动态3D高斯泼溅框架，通过频域感知的拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动态属性和自适应高斯分割策略，解决了现有方法在动态场景中的过平滑和特征碰撞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D高斯泼溅方法在动态场景建模中存在过平滑或特征碰撞的问题，这是由于运动细节保留和变形一致性之间的频谱冲突所导致。

Method: 采用了混合显式-隐式函数框架，包含频域感知的拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动态属性和KDTree引导的自适应高斯分割策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中实现了最佳性能，显著提高了重建的保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态3D高斯泼溅框架有效解决了频谱冲突问题，为动态场景建模提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 本文通过结构化回顾当前研究，详细分析了语言引导与3D高斯泼溅技术的结合方法，包括理论基础、数据整合策略和实际应用案例。

Result: 研究揭示了当前技术的局限性，如计算瓶颈、泛化能力不足以及语义标注数据的稀缺性，并展望了未来发展方向。

Conclusion: 尽管语言引导的3D高斯泼溅技术在场景理解方面展现出潜力，但仍需解决计算效率、数据标注等挑战，以推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding
using Gaussian Splatting.

### [5] [RAP: Real-time Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05115)
*Fangyu Du,Taiqing Li,Ziwei Zhang,Qian Qiao,Tan Yu,Dingcheng Zhen,Xu Jia,Yang Yang,Shunshun Yin,Siyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RAP是一种实时音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练推理范式实现高质量的实时动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能够生成高质量的肖像动画，但由于计算复杂度过高，无法满足实时部署的需求。RAP旨在在实时约束下生成高质量的动画。

Method: RAP引入了一种混合注意力机制用于细粒度音频控制，以及静态-动态训练推理范式避免显式运动监督。

Result: 实验表明，RAP在实时约束下实现了最先进的性能，能够精确控制音频驱动的动画并保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RAP通过创新的方法解决了高质量实时肖像动画生成的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

*Mohamed Abdul Gafoor,Marius Preda,Titus Zaharia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于惯性体积的新型密度控制方法，用于改进3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中的点基元管理，并通过实验验证其在重建质量上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3DGS密度控制策略存在不足，影响了高质量新视角合成的效果。本文旨在通过改进密度控制方法，提升3DGS的重建质量。

Method: 提出了一种新型密度控制方法，利用高斯函数的惯性体积指导细化过程，并研究了传统SfM和深度图像匹配（DIM）方法在点云初始化中的效果。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在重建质量上超越了3DGS，并在多样场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过优化密度控制策略，显著提升了3DGS的重建性能，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为GASP的算法，用于生成Reeb图的可视化，满足边界约束、紧凑性和与函数梯度对齐的三项性质，较现有算法更具代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Reeb图绘制算法在可视化时忽视了或违反了边界约束、紧凑性和与函数梯度对齐的关键性质，导致可视化结果无法忠实反映数据的拓扑结构。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的算法GASP，该算法专门考虑了上述三项性质，并通过与几何重心算法（Topology ToolKit中的实现）进行对比来验证其效果。

Result: GASP算法生成的Reeb图在定性和定量评估中均优于几何重心算法，更准确地反映了数据的拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GASP算法通过满足三项关键性质，显著提升了Reeb图的可视化效果，为数据拓扑结构的表示提供了更优的方案。

Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.

Conclusion: 该研究为服装建模提供了语义分割的新方法，解决了服装与身体重叠区域的分割难题。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Result: 实现了对真实场景光照的高质量、可控编辑，并能通过自监督训练优化神经网络。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了真实场景光照编辑的物理控制能力和逼真度。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

### [10] [Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829)
*Devora Chait-Roth,Kedar S. Namjoshi,Thomas Wies*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一种保证混合模式更新一致性算法，通过分析服务行为的语义属性（如可交换性）来避免不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线服务通常采用可扩展的微服务架构，但在不停止服务的情况下进行功能更新时，会出现当前版本和新版本工作进程同时运行导致的数据不一致问题。

Method: 论文提出了一套基于服务行为语义属性的框架，通过形式化分析和理论推导，设计出新的算法来保证混合模式更新的原子性。

Result: 研究证明，只有通过语义感知的方法才能避免混合模式更新的不一致性，而语义不可知的方法无法实现这一目标。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论推导和算法设计，解决了混合模式更新的一致性问题，为在线服务的动态更新提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

### [11] [Online EFX Allocations with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04779)
*Themistoklis Melissourgos,Nicos Protopapas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在线公平分配问题，目标是实现最终分配的EFX（对任意商品的嫉妒自由），但由于近似EFX分配在一般情况下不可实现，研究引入了预测机制以提高分配效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线分配问题中，如何在不完整信息下实现公平分配（EFX）是一个挑战，研究希望通过引入预测机制来弥补这一不足。

Method: 研究采用预测向量估计代理的真实估值（如机器学习模型生成），并通过总变差距离衡量预测误差。针对加性估值的情况，分析了仅依赖预测或完全忽略预测的算法的局限性，并设计了一种结合预测和真实值的算法。

Result: 研究表明，在没有预测或仅依赖预测的情况下，近似EFX分配不可实现。但对于两个具有相同估值的代理，提出的算法能够利用预测信息逐步逼近EFX分配，其效果随预测准确性的提高而改善。

Conclusion: 研究突出了在线公平分配中预测机制的重要性，并表明合理利用预测信息可以在一定程度上实现公平分配目标，尤其是在代理估值相同的情况下。

Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good
arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be
immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to
ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.
Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in
general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting
algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine
learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we
measure their error using the total variation distance from the true
valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with
the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility
results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore
predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both
the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the
prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate
EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary
to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the
necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.
The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy
of the predictions increases.

Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex
systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across
edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more
from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be
balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs),
users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in
terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these
heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with
multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a
fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we
propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee
energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a
social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and
numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and
energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive
services.

Abstract: This article presents a new three-player version of the bridge playing card
game for the purpose of ending fixed partnerships so that the play can be more
dynamic and flexible. By dynamically redefining team makeup in real time, this
game design increases unpredictability and forces players to repeatedly update
strategy. A novel scoring system is introduced to reduce biases present in
conventional rule-based games by favoring fairness via reward systems that
enforce tactical decision making and risk assessment. Being subject to regular
bridge rules, this version tests players to collaborate without fixed
friendships, requiring fluid adjustment and adaptive bidding behavior in real
time. Strategic issues involve aggressive and defensive bidding, adaptable
playing styles, and loss-seeking strategies specific to the three-player
structure. The article discusses probabilistic issues of bidding, trump and
no-trump declarative effects, and algorithmic methods to trick-taking.
Simulation outcomes illustrate the efficiency of diverse strategies. The game's
architecture is ideal for competitions and possibly influential in broadening
entry pools for tournament card games.
