The main analytical challenge is that buyer type is two-dimensional\n(valuation and arrival time), which makes equilibrium intractable under general\nstrategies.

Despite its conceptual appeal, VCC adoption is\nhindered by the lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating its profitability\nand environmental advantages in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles the\nfundamental question: Can VCC be both profitable and sustainable? We address\nthis problem by proposing a management scheme for VCC that combines\nenergy-aware task allocation with a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism.\nOur framework is the first to jointly model latency, energy consumption,\nmonetary incentives, and carbon emissions within urban mobility and 5G\ncommunication settings. The task allocation strategy maximizes the aggregate\nstakeholder utility while satisfying deadlines and minimizing energy costs. The\npayoffs are distributed via a coalitional game theory adapted to dynamic\nvehicular environments, to prevent disincentivizing participants with\npotentially negative contributions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our\napproach supports low-latency task execution, enables effective monetization of\nvehicular resources, and reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99% compared to\nconventional edge infrastructures, making VCC a practical and sustainable\nalternative to edge computing."}

In the popular\nmatching problem, (a subset of) the vertices in a graph have preference\norderings over their potential matches. A matching is popular if it gets a\nplurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other matching.\nUnfortunately, popular matchings typically do not exist. So we study a natural\nrelaxation, namely popular winning sets which are a set of matchings that\ncollectively get a plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other\nmatching. The $\\textit{popular dimension}$ is the minimum cardinality of a\npopular winning set, in the worst case over the problem class.\n  We prove that the popular dimension is exactly $2$ in the house allocation\nproblem, even if the voters are weighted and ties are allowed in their\npreference lists. For the marriage problem and the roommates problem, we prove\nthat the popular dimension is between $2$ and $3$, when the agents are weighted\nand/or their preferences orderings allow ties. In the special case where the\nagents are unweighted and have strict preference orderings, the popular\ndimension of the marriage problem is known to be exactly $1$ and we prove the\npopular dimension of the roommates problem is exactly $2$."}

Project Page https://johann.wang/Light-SQ/", "summary": "In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on\nimage-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,\nprimitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios\nby compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.\nTowards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be\nstructure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware\nalignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel\nsuperquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes\nstructure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to\niteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap\nbetween primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by\nstructure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to\ndrive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on\nSDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In\naddition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement\nto preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce\n3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both\nreconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape\nabstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the\nfeasibility of 3D UGC creation."}

However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D\nmeshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual\ntask that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry\nsurveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset\ncreation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,\nexisting automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:\n(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts\nacross shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in\nregions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate\nthe mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable\nframework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-\nand visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)\nsegments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned\nper-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts\ninto a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion\n(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted\nseam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we\nshow that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture\ngeneration and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.\nOur implementation code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/AHHHZ975/Semantic-Visibility-UV-Param."}
