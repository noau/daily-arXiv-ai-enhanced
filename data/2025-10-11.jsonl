Existing\napproaches to enforce this separation include monads, type-and-effect systems,\nand capability systems. All share a tension between precision and usability,\nand each one has non-obvious strengths and weaknesses.\n  This paper aims to raise the bar in assessing such systems. First, we propose\na semantic definition of purity, inspired by contextual equivalence, as a\nbaseline independent of any specific typing discipline. Second, we propose that\nexpressiveness should be measured by the degree of completeness, i.e., how many\nsemantically pure terms can be typed as pure. Using this measure, we focus on\nminimal meaningful effect and capability systems and show that they are\nincomparable, i.e., neither subsumes the other in terms of expressiveness.\n  Based on this result, we propose a synthesis and show that type, ability, and\neffect systems combine their respective strengths while avoiding their\nweaknesses. As part of our formal model, we provide a logical relation to\nfacilitate proofs of purity and other properties for a variety of effect typing\ndisciplines."}

It extends the\nlambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed\ntermination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control\nflow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order\ncomputation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and\nnon-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value\nlambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's\ncall-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to\nbranching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a\nminimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception\nhandling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.\n  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the\n(simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand\nstacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential,\nbranching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation\nand a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and\nstrong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These\nproperties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified\nfunctional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct\nand intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics."}

Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,\noffer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and\nanimation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which\nfonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially\nserve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated\ndesign optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized\nin creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune\nfont parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design\nand animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill\nthe current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation\nthat differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of\nvariable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the\ntext. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to\nvariable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of\nenergies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized\nimages.
