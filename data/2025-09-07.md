Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ContraGS是一种方法，通过压缩3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）表示而不减少高斯数量，显著减少了GPU内存消耗和训练/渲染延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）需要大量3D高斯以获得高质量表示，但这会增加GPU内存消耗和训练/渲染延迟。ContraGS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ContraGS利用代码簿紧凑存储高斯参数向量，并通过贝叶斯推断框架和非可微参数的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）采样来解决训练问题。

Result: ContraGS显著减少了训练期间的峰值内存（平均3.49倍），并加速了训练和渲染（平均分别1.36倍和1.88倍），同时保持了接近最优的质量。

Conclusion: ContraGS提供了一种高效的方法，在不显著牺牲质量的情况下减少内存使用和加速训练/渲染，解决了3DGS模型的压缩训练问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过GPU并行优化，弹性杆模型可以高效地应用于实时物理模拟，尤其是在医疗设备的模拟中表现出色，为未来的实时交互应用提供了技术基础。

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

### [8] [When Lifetimes Liberate: A Type System for Arenas with Higher-Order Reachability Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04253)
*Siyuan He,Songlin Jia,Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的资源管理方法，结合了区域系统和所有权类型的优点，实现了资源共享和静态生命周期控制。通过扩展可达性类型，提出了两种新的计算模型，并在Rocq中进行了形式化和类型安全验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶函数语言中的静态资源管理因控制、表达性和灵活性之间的矛盾而具有挑战性。现有的区域系统和所有权类型虽各具优势，但存在局限性。为了解决这些问题，论文试图统一它们的优点。

Method: 论文提出了两种新的扩展：基于可达性类型的A<:和{A}<:，分别用于粗粒度资源共享和词法生命周期控制。这些扩展在Rocq中形式化，并验证了类型安全性。

Result: 通过A<:和{A}<:，论文实现了资源共享和静态生命周期控制的统一。{A}<:作为首个用于生命周期控制的可达性形式化方法，避免了流敏感推理的复杂性，同时保持了表达性和简洁性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在高阶语言中实现了灵活的资源管理和静态安全保证，同时保留了语言的参数化特性，为资源管理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将信任定义为重复博弈中认知捷径的模型，并分析了信任策略在社交困境中的演化及其对合作水平的提升作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏理论模型常混淆合作行为与信任，导致难以测量信任及其在不同社交困境中的影响。论文旨在通过形式化信任为认知捷径来解决这一问题。

Method: 研究通过在重复博弈中定义一个基于信任的启发式策略（即一旦观察到合作行为阈值即停止检查对方行为），系统分析了这些策略在对称两人社交困境中的演化。

Result: 研究发现，在检查对方行为成本较高时，基于信任的策略能在许多社交困境中胜过标准互惠策略（如以牙还牙）。此外，信任能提升总体合作水平，尤其在存在行为误差的情况下。

Conclusion: 研究证明了信任启发式对个体的适应性益处，并提出了信任如何促进不同类型社交互动的形式化理论，为人类与人工智能交互提供了启示。

Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic
models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This
makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different
social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive
shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's
actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We
consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and
systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric
social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another
agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,
then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such
as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust
increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in
cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs
even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.
Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of
using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote
cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the
implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial
intelligence agents.
