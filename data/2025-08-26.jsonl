To achieve this goal,\nwe first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset\ncomprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In\naddition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance\ngeneration coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.\nConsidering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable\niterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a\nprediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions.

One challenge in defining incentive\ncompatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit\nreports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a\nrange of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion\nof Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that\nauctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their\ndefinition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome\nof an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome\nof any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both\nFirst-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC\ndefinition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints\nthat the advertiser can report.\n  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse\nAuto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding\nIncentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting\nis preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than\nthe least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This\ndistinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for\nadvertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that\nSPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to\nemploy uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive\nproperties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering\nadvertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection."}

This enables sellers to offer\npersonalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to\nnon-profiled users.

Today, major online\nsellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to\nbetter track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper\npresents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their\nsocial activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller\nshould strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in\nsocial networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller\nand users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this\ngame comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well\nas among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure\nconsistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under\nrandom user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying\nbackward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique\nperfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as\nthe accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the\nequilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and\nfacilitate user profiling.

We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation\nand demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a\nmore reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the\nstandard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is\nsubstantial noise in the outcomes/labels."}

The attacker tries to\ncompromise the system through probing actions, while the defender minimizes the\nrisk by reimaging the system, balancing between performance cost and security\nlevel. We demonstrate that the optimal strategies for both players follow a\nthreshold structure. Based on this insight, we propose a structure-aware policy\ngradient reinforcement learning algorithm that helps both players converge to\nthe Nash equilibrium. This approach enhances the defender's ability to adapt\nand effectively counter evolving threats, improving the overall security of the\nsystem. Finally, we validate the proposed method through numerical simulations."}
