TL;DR: PoissonNet是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过局部-全局学习方案解决了现有网格架构在高频特征学习、感受野不足、对离散化敏感和计算开销效率低等问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络架构在学习网格时存在多种问题，如高频特征学习困难、感受野不足、对离散化敏感以及计算开销效率低。PoissonNet通过局部-全局学习方法解决了这些问题。

Method: PoissonNet采用Poisson方程作为特征传播的主要机制，通过在网格的梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解Poisson系统来实现全局特征更新。

Result: PoissonNet在高频特征学习和全局感受野方面表现出色，计算效率高，并且在语义分割和动画曲面参数化等实验中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PoissonNet在网格学习中表现出卓越的性能，特别是在学习变形任务中，显著优于现有的表面学习方法。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

### [2] [HITrees: Higher-Order Interaction Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14558)
*Amir Mohammad Fadaei Ayyam,Michael Sammler*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了高阶交互树（HITrees），这是第一种支持高阶效应的交互树变体，通过设计高阶输入的效应概念和使用反函数化技术实现高阶输出的低阶表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互树的效应概念不支持高阶效应（如并行组合和call/cc），而这些效应对复杂语义建模至关重要。

Method: 提出高阶交互树（HITrees），通过设计高阶输入的效应概念和使用反函数化技术实现高阶输出的低阶表示，并在Lean证明助手中实现。

Result: HITrees成功支持高阶效应，并提供了两种解释（状态转移系统和单子程序），应用于具有并行组合和call/cc的语言语义定义。

Conclusion: HITrees为解决高阶效应建模问题提供了有效的解决方案，展示了其在复杂语义定义中的表达能力和实用性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rise of compositional semantics as a
foundation for formal verification of complex systems. In particular,
interaction trees have emerged as a popular denotational semantics. Interaction
trees achieve compositionality by providing a reusable library of effects.
However, their notion of effects does not support higher-order effects, i.e.,
effects that take or return monadic computations. Such effects are essential to
model complex semantic features like parallel composition and call/cc.
  We introduce Higher-Order Interaction Trees (HITrees), the first variant of
interaction trees to support higher-order effects in a non-guarded type theory.
HITrees accomplish this through two key techniques: first, by designing the
notion of effects such that the fixpoints of effects with higher-order input
can be expressed as inductive types inside the type theory; and second, using
defunctionalization to encode higher-order outputs into a first-order
representation. We implement HITrees in the Lean proof assistant, accompanied
by a comprehensive library of effects including concurrency, recursion, and
call/cc. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of HITrees, as state
transition systems and as monadic programs. To demonstrate the expressiveness
of HITrees, we apply them to define the semantics of a language with parallel
composition and call/cc.

### [3] [Why Instant-Runoff Voting Is So Resilient to Coalitional Manipulation: Phase Transitions in the Perturbed Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14450)
*François Durand*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文分析了三种投票规则（多数制、两轮制和即时复选制）在联盟操纵（CM）下的易感性，发现每种规则在偏好集中度的临界值theta_c处发生相变。研究表明，即时复选制因其超级孔多塞赢家（SCW）的存在，即使在极小偏好集中度下也高度抗CM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明即时复选制（IRV）对联盟操纵（CM）高度抵抗，但其理论原因尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析三种主要投票规则在偏好扰动模型中对CM的易感性。

Method: 在偏好扰动模型（Perturbed Culture model）中，分析了多数制、两轮制和即时复选制对CM的易感性，并引入超级孔多塞赢家（SCW）概念。

Result: 研究发现，每种投票规则在偏好集中度的临界值theta_c处发生相变：对于大型选民群体，CM概率在theta_c以下指数收敛于1，theta_c以上则收敛于0。IRV的theta_c=0，表明其对CM高度抵抗。

Conclusion: 超级孔多塞赢家（SCW）的存在是即时复选制抵抗联盟操纵的关键因素。研究结果表明，IRV即使在极小偏好集中度下也能有效抵抗CM。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

### [4] [Co-Investment under Revenue Uncertainty Based on Stochastic Coalitional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14555)
*Amal Sakr,Andrea Araldo,Tijani Chahed,Daniel Kofman*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对移动边缘计算（MEC）服务的共同投资方案，通过联盟博弈理论解决多个利益相关者在不确定性收入下的成本与收益共享问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MEC服务的大规模部署需要多方投资，单一利益相关者难以承担，因此需要设计一种共同投资方案以保证联盟的稳定性和盈利性。

Method: 采用随机联盟博弈理论，结合鲁棒博弈理论，提出了一种新颖的框架，分析了联盟在收入不确定情况下的稳定性与盈利性。

Result: 数值结果表明，当服务提供商的收入相似且投资周期足够长时，联盟的稳定性概率较高；而在收入高度波动时，联盟仍可能盈利。

Conclusion: 研究表明，共同投资方案在多种收入情况下是可行的，尤其在长期投资和收入相似的情况下，联盟稳定性较高。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

*Andrei Seoev,Leonid Gremyachikh,Anastasiia Smirnova,Yash Madhwal,Alisa Kalacheva,Dmitry Belousov,Ilia Zubov,Aleksei Smirnov,Denis Fedyanin,Vladimir Gorgadze,Yury Yanovich*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于在Polygon Atlas网络中进行MEV（最大可提取价值）提取，解决了传统博弈论方法在高频率、部分可观测环境中的局限性，显著提升了利润捕获能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链网络中，交易块的战略排序已成为利润提取的重要来源（MEV）。从公开竞价转向密封竞拍机制（如Polygon Atlas）减少了网络拥堵，但也引入了在高频率、部分可观测环境中制定最优竞标策略的挑战。传统博弈论方法在此环境下效果不佳。

Method: 论文提出了一个强化学习框架，包括：（1）模拟环境，精准建模Arbitrage机会的随机性和拍卖竞争；（2）基于PPO的实时竞标代理，能够在连续动作空间中自适应制定策略；（3）历史条件代理的实证验证。

Result: 实证结果表明，该历史条件代理在与现有搜索者共存时捕获了49%的可用利润，替代市场领导者时捕获了81%，显著优于静态竞标策略。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在高频率MEV环境中，强化学习方法提供了传统优化方法无法实现的显著优势，为工业参与者和协议设计者提供了直接价值。

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

### [6] [Online Proportional Apportionment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14752)
*Javier Cembrano,Jose Correa,Svenja M. Griesbach,Victor Verdugo*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线比例分配问题，提出了动态环境下的席位分配框架，分析了确定性和随机性方法的性能，并证明了在某些条件下最优分配的存在性和可实现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的立法机构席位分配问题通常被视为一次性过程，忽略了动态因素的影响。然而，在许多实际场景中，动态因素起着重要作用。因此，本文旨在探索在线环境下的比例分配问题。

Method: 论文引入了在线比例分配的框架，其中时间离散，n个政党在每个时间步获得一定的票数份额。在线算法需要在每个时间步不可撤销地分配一定数量的席位，确保每个政党的累积席位与其累积份额接近。研究了确定性和随机性分配方法，并分析其性能。

Result: 对于确定性方法，论文证明了最坏情况下累积席位与累积份额的偏差下限为O(n)，并且贪婪方法可以达到这一最优界限。对于随机性方法，证明了在n≤3时可以实现全局配额和期望比例分配的混合方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，动态环境下的席位分配问题可以通过确定性和随机性方法得到有效解决，尤其是在n≤3的情况下，可以通过随机化方法实现更优的分配结果。

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

### [7] [Learnable Mixed Nash Equilibria are Collectively Rational](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14907)
*Geelon So,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了具有非渐进稳定性的博弈学习动态，发现均匀稳定性与弱帕累托最优性密切相关，并展示了其在增量平滑最佳响应动态中的收敛行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是探讨博弈学习中非渐进稳定性动态的性质及其与集体理性的联系，特别是在混合纳什均衡的情境下。

Method: 通过均匀稳定性的概念，结合非退化条件和战略等价性分析，探讨了混合均衡的稳定性和帕累托最优性的关系。

Result: 研究发现，如果混合均衡不是均匀稳定的，则其不具有弱帕累托最优性；反之，若均衡局部均匀稳定，则必须满足弱帕累托最优性。此外，均匀稳定性决定了增量平滑最佳响应动态的收敛行为。

Conclusion: 研究表明，混合纳什均衡附近的个体效用追求行为可以导致集体理性，这与严格均衡附近的动态行为不同。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.
