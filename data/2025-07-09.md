Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

### [3] [Fairness-Aware Static and Dynamic Assortment Optimization: Optimal Selection with Balanced Market Share](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05606)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线零售商在品类优化中纯粹追求收入最大化可能导致销售不平衡，引发供应商不满和产品多样性减少。为解决公平性问题，论文引入市场份额平衡约束。

Method: 论文研究了静态和动态设定下的多分对数模型。在静态设定中，通过满足市场份额平衡约束的分布选择最优品类；在动态设定中，设计了一个渐近最优的动态策略。

Result: 静态设定中的问题可在多项式时间内求解，并发现最优解的明确结构；动态设定中的策略在库存增长时逼近最优解，近似比率趋于1。

Conclusion: 引入市场份额平衡约束的品类优化问题在静态和动态设定下均可有效解决，兼顾公平性和收入最大化。

Abstract: Assortment optimization is a critical tool for online retailers aiming to
maximize revenue. However, optimizing purely for revenue can lead to imbalanced
sales across products, potentially causing supplier disengagement and reduced
product diversity. To address these fairness concerns, we introduce a market
share balancing constraint that limits the disparity in expected sales between
any two offered products to a factor of a given parameter $\alpha$. We study
both static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit
(MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller
selects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share
balancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue. We show that this
problem can be solved in polynomial time, and we characterize the structure of
the optimal solution: a product is included if and only if its revenue and
preference weight exceed certain thresholds. We further extend our analysis to
settings with additional feasibility constraints on the assortment and
demonstrate that, given a $\beta$-approximation oracle for the constrained
problem, we can construct a $\beta$-approximation algorithm under the fairness
constraint. In the dynamic setting, each product has a finite initial
inventory, and the seller implements a dynamic policy to maximize total
expected revenue while respecting both inventory limits and the market share
balancing constraint in expectation. We design a policy that is asymptotically
optimal, with its approximation ratio converging to one as inventories grow
large.

Abstract: Minimal balanced collections are a generalization of partitions of a finite
set of n elements and have important applications in cooperative game theory
and discrete mathematics. However, their number is not known beyond n = 4. In
this paper we investigate the problem of generating minimal balanced
collections and implement the Peleg algorithm, permitting to generate all
minimal balanced collections till n = 7. Secondly, we provide practical
algorithms to check many properties of coalitions and games, based on minimal
balanced collections, in a way which is faster than linear programming-based
methods. In particular, we construct an algorithm to check if the core of a
cooperative game is a stable set in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.
The algorithm implements a theorem according to which the core is a stable set
if and only if a certain nested balancedness condition is valid. The second
level of this condition requires generalizing the notion of balanced collection
to balanced sets.

### [5] [Rethinking Pricing in Energy Markets: Pay-as-Bid vs Pay-as-Clear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06035)
*Ioannis Caragiannis,Zhile Jiang,Stratis Skoulakis*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了能源市场中Pay-as-Clear (PC)和Pay-as-Bid (PB)两种定价机制的选择问题，提出了理论结果并支持PB机制在战略行为下的成本优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源市场设计需要权衡PC和PB两种定价机制的优劣，以最小化总成本并应对战略行为。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PC和PB机制，并基于无遗憾学习动态进行广泛模拟验证。

Result: 理论上，PB机制在所有市场实例中的最坏情况均衡价格均低于PC机制，证实了其抗战略操纵的稳健性。模拟结果也支持PB机制的平均市场价格更低。

Conclusion: PB机制在应对战略行为和降低总能源成本方面表现出更强的稳健性，为能源市场设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The design of energy markets is a subject of ongoing debate, particularly
concerning the choice between the widely adopted Pay-as-Clear (PC) pricing
mechanism and the alternative Pay-as-Bid (PB). These mechanisms determine how
energy producers are compensated: under PC, all selected producers are paid the
market-clearing price (i.e., the highest accepted bid), while under PB, each
selected producer is paid their own submitted bid. The overarching objective is
to meet the total demand for energy at minimal cost in the presence of
strategic behavior. We present two key theoretical results. First, no mechanism
can uniformly dominate PC or PB. This means that for any mechanism
$\mathcal{M}$, there exists a market configuration and a mixed-strategy Nash
equilibrium of PC (respectively for PB) that yields strictly lower total energy
costs than under $\mathcal{M}$. Second, in terms of worst-case equilibrium
outcomes, PB consistently outperforms PC: across all market instances, the
highest possible equilibrium price under PB is strictly lower than that under
PC. This suggests a structural robustness of PB to strategic manipulation.
These theoretical insights are further supported by extensive simulations based
on no-regret learning dynamics, which consistently yield lower average market
prices in several energy market settings.
