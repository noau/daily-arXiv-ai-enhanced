Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules."}

Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\\top\\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda."}

Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations."}

Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction."}

In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content."}

In doing so, the learner must guarantee not to subsidize the market. This constraint is usually imposed per round through Weak Budget Balance (WBB). Despite that, Bernasconi et al. [2024] show that a Global Budget Balance (GBB) constraint on the profit -- enforced over the entire time horizon -- can improve the GFT by a multiplicative factor of two. While this might appear to be a marginal relaxation, this implies that all existing WBB-focused algorithms suffer linear regret when measured against the GBB optimum. In this work, we provide the first algorithm to achieve sublinear regret against the GBB benchmark in stochastic environments under one-bit feedback. In particular, we show that when the joint distribution of valuations has a bounded density, our algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret. Our result shows that there is no separation between the one-dimensional problem of learning the optimal WBB price and the two-dimensional problem of learning the optimal GBB distribution over pairs of prices."}

However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians."}

Each agent controls an ``episode\": a short sequence of consecutive decisions. Motivating applications include users repeatedly interacting with an AI, or repeatedly shopping at a marketplace. While agents are incentivized to explore within their respective episodes, we show that the aggregate exploration fails: e.g., its Bayesian regret grows linearly over time. In fact, such failure is a (very) typical case, not just a worst-case scenario. This conclusion persists even if an agent's per-episode utility is some fixed function of the per-round outcomes: e.g., $\\min$ or $\\max$, not just the sum. Thus, externally driven exploration is needed even when some amount of exploration happens organically."}

We introduce a split-kernel scheme that decouples fluid updates from solid boundary handling, substantially reducing warp divergence and improving utilization on GPUs. We further perform the first von Neumann stability analysis of the high-order moment-encoded LBM (HOME-LBM) formulation, characterizing its spectral behavior and deriving stability bounds for individual moment components. These theoretical insights directly guide a practical 16-bit moment quantization without compromising numerical stability. Our framework achieves up to 6x speedup and reduces GPU memory footprint by up to 50% in fluid-only scenarios and 25% in scenes with complex solid boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art LBM solver, while preserving physical fidelity across a range of large-scale benchmarks and real-time demonstrations. The proposed approach enables scalable, stable, and high-resolution LBM simulation on a single GPU, bridging theoretical stability analysis with practical GPU algorithm design."}

To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.\n  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely."}

While generating raster images from 3D geometry via Monte Carlo raytracing is commonplace, there is no corresponding practical approach for robustly and directly extracting editable vector images with shading information from 3D geometry. To fill this gap, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem over the space of geometries and colors of diffusion curve handles, and solve it with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. At the core of our method is a novel differential boundary element method (BEM) framework that reconstructs colors from diffusion curve handles and computes gradients with respect to their parameters, requiring the expensive matrix factorization only once at the beginning of the optimization. Unlike triangulation-based techniques that require a clean domain decomposition, our method is robust to geometrically challenging scenarios, such as intersecting diffusion curves, and to color noise in the target image, enabling the direct use of noisy Monte Carlo samples without requiring a converged, error-free input image. We demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach across several test cases. Finally, we highlight several open questions raised by our work, which spans both theory and applications."}
