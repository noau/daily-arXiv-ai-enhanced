Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设施选址问题中，每个代理只关心最近的选择设施，而本研究关注的是所有代理与委员会成员的距离总和最小化问题，并引入新的公平性公理NORP以防止代理子集的过度代表。

Method: 研究了在公共度量空间中选择k个代理作为委员会的优化问题，提出了新的公平性公理NORP，并设计算法以形成低成本、公平且符合NORP的委员会。

Result: 结果显示，可以找到低成本、公平且符合NORP的委员会解决方案，验证了新公理的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在公共度量空间中，总能形成低成本、公平且具有代表性的委员会，同时满足新的NORP公平性公理。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents
from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is
related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median
problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each
agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we
consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to
them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to
minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen
committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both
low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing
notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings.
Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we
call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While
all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this
intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously
low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to
form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.

### [3] [Instance-Adaptive Hypothesis Tests with Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21178)
*Flora C. Shi,Martin J. Wainwright,Stephen Bates*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何在具有私有信息的策略性异质群体中进行假设检验，通过设计统计合同菜单诱导代理根据私有信息自选类型，从而匹配预言机性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于异质群体中单一检验的统计误差表现不佳，需设计方法利用代理的私有信息优化检验性能。

Method: 方法包括设计统计合同菜单，将类型最优检验与支付结构配对，诱导代理自选类型，实现预言机性能匹配。

Result: 结果显示分离菜单设计能完全匹配预言机性能，且信息诱导成本可忽略，显著改善统计误差。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法将统计决策理论与机制设计结合，利用异质性和策略参与提升假设检验效率。

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贿赂模型忽略了选民之间的社交影响，而现实中社交网络会放大贿赂效果，因此研究社交网络中的贿赂行为更具现实意义。

Method: 将选民建模为有向加权图中的节点，边代表社交影响力，研究直接和传播效应的整合作用。

Result: 证明该问题即使在两候选人情况下也是NP完全的，但针对特定网络结构提出了多项式时间算法和伪多项式算法。

Conclusion: 研究为社交网络中贿赂行为的复杂性提供了详细分析，并提出了针对特定结构的有效算法。

Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying
voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters
act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in
reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a
social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby
amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,
where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs
represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not
confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the
network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and
individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a
designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists
within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and
network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is
NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when
parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design
polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority
rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for
transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform
arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further
prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as
parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and
pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform
arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for
shift bribery in social networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在不同的拍卖规模下（高价和低价物品）设计出稳健的拍卖机制，以实现最优收入的最坏情况下乘法近似。

Method: 提出了一种尺度不变的优化机制，该机制随机选择在第二价格或第二价格的2.45倍之间进行销售。

Result: 研究表明，所提出的尺度不变机制能够在最坏情况下实现最优收入的乘法近似。

Conclusion: 尺度不变的拍卖机制具有广泛的适用性，能够在不同规模的拍卖中保持最优性能。

Abstract: We study auctions that are robust at any scale, i.e., they can be applied to
sell both expensive and cheap items and achieve the best multiplicative
approximations of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We show that the
optimal mechanism is scale invariant, which randomizes between selling at the
second-price and a 2.45 multiple of the second-price.

Main category: cs.GT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体系统中设计激励以诱导理想的纳什均衡是一个关键而复杂的问题，尤其是在大规模系统中。

Result: 研究表明，AMID算法在多种拍卖场景中显著提升了收益，并优于现有的基准方法。

Conclusion: AMID算法为解决大规模多智能体系统的激励设计问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

### [7] [Privacy Guarantee for Nash Equilibrium Computation of Aggregative Games Based on Pointwise Maximal Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21668)
*Zhaoyang Cheng,Guanpu Chen,Tobias J. Oechtering,Mikael Skoglund*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于点态最大泄漏（PML）的隐私保护框架，用于聚合博弈中的纳什均衡计算，解决了差分隐私（DP）在处理相关数据集时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私在保护隐私时未能利用数据集的事先分布知识，也无法有效评估相关数据集的信息泄漏问题，因此需要一种更精确的隐私保护方法。

Method: 通过引入点态最大泄漏（PML）框架，并结合玩家成本函数数据集的先验知识，实现对隐私泄漏的精确计算和上界保证。

Result: PML在整体和个体视角下均优于DP，能够提供更紧密的隐私保证，并揭示DP在处理相关数据集时的不足。

Conclusion: PML作为一种更合适的隐私度量标准，优于DP，尤其是在处理相关数据集时表现出更强的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium
(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely
employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional
knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for
correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise
maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By
incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a
precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In
the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy
guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the
individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper
bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize
that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to
adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct
experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information
to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.
