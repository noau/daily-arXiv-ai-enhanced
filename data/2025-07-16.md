### [1] [Developing and evaluating quilts for the depiction of large layered graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10883)
*Juhee Bae,Benjamin Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种Quilts设计（纯颜色、纯文本、混合）对跳转链接的表现，发现混合设计在某些情况下优于纯文本设计，且整体上Quilts比节点链接图和矩阵图更快帮助用户找到路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分层图（如流程图）在复杂性增加时难以理解，Quilts作为一种基于矩阵的图形表现方式，旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究首先改进Quilts，开发了三种设计（纯颜色、纯文本、混合跳转链接表现），并通过两种实验分别比较设计的优劣以及Quilts与传统节点链接图和矩阵图的性能。

Result: 实验发现，纯颜色跳转链接表现的速度和准确性显著较低，混合表现在某些情况下优于纯文本表现；整体上Quilts的路径查找速度（46.6秒）显著快于节点链接图（58.3秒）和矩阵图（71.2秒）。

Conclusion: Quilts在复杂图形中表现优于传统节点链接图和矩阵图，尤其是在大型图形中，混合跳转链接设计有助于提升用户路径查找效率。

Abstract: Traditional layered graph depictions such as flow charts are in wide use. Yet
as graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to
understand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to
address this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing
three design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to
better-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is
their depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding
layer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only,
text-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path
finding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less
accurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage
over the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the
mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results
show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts
(46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams.
This speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs,
55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).

### [2] [OffsetCrust: Variable-Radius Offset Approximation with Power Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10924)
*Zihan Zhao,Pengfei Wang,Minfeng Xu,Shuangmin Chen,Shiqing Xin,Changhe Tu,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: OffsetCrust是一种新颖的框架，通过计算功率图高效解决变半径偏移表面问题，并通过轻量级微调程序减少常见的不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变半径偏移表面的计算是一个具有挑战性的问题，而现有方法在解决这一问题上存在不足。

Method: OffsetCrust通过构造功率图来处理变半径偏移表面，基点的采样和位移方向的选择是关键步骤。

Result: 实验验证了OffsetCrust的准确性和效率，并展示了其在从中间轴变换（MAT）表示重建原始边界表面等应用中的实用性。

Conclusion: OffsetCrust为变半径偏移表面的计算提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Offset surfaces, defined as the Minkowski sum of a base surface and a rolling
ball, play a crucial role in geometry processing, with applications ranging
from coverage motion planning to brush modeling. While considerable progress
has been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing
variable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper,
we present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the
variable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote
the radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is
constructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base
points on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along
$R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement
directions align exactly with the surface normals of $S$. Moreover, our method
mitigates the misalignment issues commonly seen in crust-based approaches
through a lightweight fine-tuning procedure. We validate the accuracy and
efficiency of OffsetCrust through extensive experiments, and demonstrate its
practical utility in applications such as reconstructing original boundary
surfaces from medial axis transform (MAT) representations.

### [3] [Elevating 3D Models: High-Quality Texture and Geometry Refinement from a Low-Quality Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11465)
*Nuri Ryu,Jiyun Won,Jooeun Son,Minsu Gong,Joo-Haeng Lee,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Elevate3D是一个将低质量3D资产提升为高质量的框架，核心是HFS-SDEdit纹理增强方法，并通过交替优化纹理和几何体实现最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的3D资产在计算机图形和3D视觉中应用广泛，但由于获取成本高而稀缺，因此需要高效的方法将其从低质量提升为高质量。

Method: Elevate3D采用基于HFS-SDEdit的纹理增强方法，同时交替优化纹理和几何体，并利用最新的单目几何预测器确保几何细节精确。

Result: Elevate3D在3D模型细化中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了3D资产的质量，弥补了高质量开源3D资产的不足。

Conclusion: Elevate3D通过结合纹理和几何体的优化，为解决高质量3D资产稀缺问题提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer
graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.
To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that
transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the
core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that
significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and
geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a
view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.
Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our
framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by
employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures
detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced
texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art
quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of
high-quality open-source 3D assets.

### [4] [Stream programs are monoid homomorphisms with state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10799)
*Tyler Hou,Michael Arntzenius,Max Willsey*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一类确定性流函数，并证明它们可以作为态射实现到“状态”幺半群中，其法则比之前的流程序优化语义框架更简单，同时支持丰富的等式推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程序优化语义框架条件复杂，论文旨在提出一种更简化的方法，同时支持丰富的等式推理能力。

Method: 将确定性流函数定义为态射到“状态”幺半群中，利用简化的态射法则实现流程序的优化。

Result: 该方法支持顺序组合、并行组合和反馈等丰富的流程序操作，并通过分区数据库连接、分层否定和简化TCP模型等示例验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法简化了流程序优化的语义框架，并展示了其在多种复杂场景下的适用性。

Abstract: We define a broad class of deterministic stream functions and show they can
be implemented as homomorphisms into a "state" monoid. The homomorphism laws
are simpler than the conditions of previous semantic frameworks for stream
program optimization, yet retain support for rich equational reasoning over
expressive dataflow programs, including sequential composition, parallel
composition, and feedback. We demonstrate this using examples of partitioned
database joins, stratified negation, and a simplified model of TCP.

### [5] [The downgrading semantics of memory safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11282)
*René Rydhof Hansen,Andreas Stenbæk Larsen,Aslan Askarov*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为"渐进分配器独立性"的概念，用于准确捕捉内存安全中与分配器相关的方面，并通过信息流技术处理内存不足和指针转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的内存安全定义基于"坏事不发生"的原则，常被认为缺乏理论依据。本文旨在提出一种更精确的语义定义，结合分配器的影响。

Method: 研究采用低级别语言模型，支持malloc和free操作，并通过信息流技术处理内存不足和指针转换问题。

Result: 提出的渐进分配器独立性概念成功捕捉了内存安全中的分配器特性，并通过信息流技术解决了相关技术挑战。

Conclusion: 本文通过信息流技术定义了渐进分配器独立性，为内存安全提供了一种更精确和理论支持的语义概念。

Abstract: Memory safety is traditionally characterized in terms of bad things that
cannot happen, an approach that is often criticized as unprincipled. Prior work
suggest a connection between memory safety and noninterference, but no
satisfactory semantic notion of memory safety is currently known.
  This work proposes a notion of gradual allocator independence that accurately
captures many allocator-specific aspects of memory safety. We consider a
low-level language with access to an allocator that provides malloc and free
primitives in a flat memory model. Pointers are just integers, and as such it
is trivial to write memory-unsafe programs. The basic intuition of gradual
allocator independence is that of noninterference, namely that allocators must
not influence program execution. This intuition is refined in two important
ways to account for the allocators running out-of-memory and for programs to
have pointer-to-integer casts. The key insight of the definition is to treat
these extensions as forms of downgrading and give them satisfactory technical
treatment using the state-of-the-art information flow machinery.

### [6] [Protocols for Verifying Smooth Strategies in Bandits and Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10567)
*Miranda Christ,Daniel Reichman,Jonathan Shafer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究多臂老虎机和标准形式游戏中验证策略近似最优性的协议，提出了一种查询次数随动作数量亚线性增长的验证方法，适用于平滑策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于玩家可选动作数量通常较大，寻求一种查询次数随动作数量亚线性增长的验证协议，以高效验证策略的近似最优性。

Method: 提出适用于平滑策略的验证协议，证明其查询次数少于学习过程，并建立了查询复杂度的下界。

Result: 验证协议成功实现了在动作数量较大时的高效验证，并证明了其在多臂老虎机和标准形式游戏中的适用性。

Conclusion: 验证协议为验证近似强平滑纳什均衡提供了一种高效方法，查询复杂度低于动作数量。

Abstract: We study protocols for verifying approximate optimality of strategies in
multi-armed bandits and normal-form games. As the number of actions available
to each player is often large, we seek protocols where the number of queries to
the utility oracle is sublinear in the number of actions. We prove that such
verification is possible for sufficiently smooth strategies that do not put too
much probability mass on any specific action. We provide protocols for
verifying that a smooth policy for a multi-armed bandit is
$\varepsilon$-optimal. Our verification protocols require provably fewer arm
queries than learning. Furthermore, we establish a nearly-tight lower bound on
the query complexity of verification in our settings. As an application, we
show how to use verification for bandits to achieve verification in normal-form
games. This gives a protocol for verifying whether a given strategy profile is
an approximate strong smooth Nash equilibrium, with a query complexity that is
sublinear in the number of actions.

### [7] [Pricing with Tips in Three-Sided Delivery Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10872)
*Yannai A. Gonczarowski,Gary Qiurui Ma,David C. Parkes*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在包含买家、商店和快递员的三方交付平台中，小费对市场均衡的影响。结果显示小费可以确保均衡存在，但高效均衡可能难以实现且计算复杂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在三方交付平台中，小费对市场定价和均衡的影响，以及如何通过小费优化市场效率。

Method: 通过建模分析市场均衡，比较有无小费的情况，并研究高效均衡的存在条件和计算复杂度。

Result: 小费可以确保市场均衡始终存在，且最优小费均衡福利不低于无小费情况。但高效均衡可能不存在，且计算最优均衡是NP难题。

Conclusion: 在特定市场结构条件下，可以实现高效小费均衡并快速计算。

Abstract: We model a delivery platform facilitating transactions among three sides:
buyers, stores, and couriers. In addition to buyers paying store-specific
purchase prices and couriers receiving store--buyer-specific delivery
compensation from the platform, each buyer has the option to directly tip for
delivery from a specific store. An equilibrium consists of prices,
compensations, tips, and transactions that clear the market, such that buyers
receive deliveries from preferred stores considering the prices and tips they
pay, and couriers deliver preferred orders considering the compensations and
tips they receive.
  We illustrate the role of tips in pricing: Without tips, an equilibrium is
only guaranteed to exist when there are at least as many couriers as buyers or
stores. In contrast, with tips an equilibrium always exists. From an efficiency
perspective, the optimal with-tip equilibrium welfare is always weakly larger
than the optimal without-tip equilibrium welfare. However, we show that even
with tips, efficient equilibria may not exist, and calculating the optimal
equilibrium welfare is NP-hard. To address these challenges, we identify
natural conditions on market structure that ensure the existence of efficient
with-tip equilibria and allow these efficient equilibria to be computed in
polynomial time.

### [8] [Fair Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11214)
*Matteo Castiglioni,Junjie Chen,Yingkai Li*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在任务分配和补偿中带有公平约束的最优合同设计问题，采用无嫉妒（EF）及其松弛形式（$\epsilon$-EF和EF1）作为公平标准，证明了EF合同的存在性，但计算其近似解在一般情况下是NP难的，并提出了一些特殊情况下的高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于如何在合同设计中引入公平约束，确保任务分配和补偿的无嫉妒性（EF）或其松弛形式（$\epsilon$-EF和EF1），尽管EF合同存在，但在一般情况下计算其最优合同是困难的。

Method: 采用了无嫉妒（EF）及其松弛形式（$\epsilon$-EF和EF1）作为公平标准，研究了在代理或任务数量恒定时的最优合同设计问题，提出了一种FPTAS算法和多项式时间算法来求解这些特殊情况下的最优合同。

Result: 结果表明，尽管一般情况下计算EF合同的近似解是NP难的，但在代理数量或任务数量恒定时，可以设计出高效的算法；同时，EF1合同的公平性代价被证明介于$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$和$O(n^2)$之间。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，尽管在某些情况下EF合同的设计和计算较为困难，但在特定约束条件下，仍然可以找到高效的最优解，并且EF1合同的公平性代价是可以控制的。

Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of designing optimal contracts under
fairness constraints on the task assignments and compensations. We adopt the
notion of envy-free (EF) and its relaxations, $\epsilon$-EF and envy-free up to
one item (EF1), in contract design settings. Unlike fair allocations, EF
contracts are guaranteed to exist. However, computing any constant-factor
approximation to the optimal EF contract is NP-hard in general, even using
$\epsilon$-EF contracts. For this reason, we consider settings in which the
number of agents or tasks is constant. Notably, while even with three agents,
finding an EF contract better than $2/5$ approximation of the optimal is
NP-hard, we are able to design an FPTAS when the number of agents is constant,
under relaxed notions of $\epsilon$-EF and EF1. Moreover, we present a
polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal EF contract when the number
of tasks is constant. Finally, we analyze the price of fairness in contract
design. We show that the price of fairness for exact EF contracts can be
unbounded, even with a single task and two agents. In contrast, for EF1
contracts, the price of fairness is bounded between $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and
$O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of agents.

### [9] [A Parallelizable Approach for Characterizing NE in Zero-Sum Games After a Linear Number of Iterations of Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11366)
*Taemin Kim,James P. Bailey*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出一种基于哈密顿动力学的新方法，用于零和游戏中的在线优化，能够在有限迭代次数内表征纳什均衡，且支持并行化和任意学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的零和游戏优化方法基于遗憾或收缩映射，但存在局限性。本研究旨在提出一种更高效且更灵活的方法。

Method: 基于哈密顿动力学的新方法，通过交替梯度下降在有限迭代次数内表征纳什均衡，支持并行化和任意学习率。

Result: 实验证明，新方法极大地优于传统方法，能够在无界设置下快速收敛到纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 新方法在零和游戏优化中表现出高效性和灵活性，为算法博弈理论提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online optimization methods for zero-sum games, a fundamental
problem in adversarial learning in machine learning, economics, and many other
domains. Traditional methods approximate Nash equilibria (NE) using either
regret-based methods (time-average convergence) or contraction-map-based
methods (last-iterate convergence). We propose a new method based on
Hamiltonian dynamics in physics and prove that it can characterize the set of
NE in a finite (linear) number of iterations of alternating gradient descent in
the unbounded setting, modulo degeneracy, a first in online optimization.
Unlike standard methods for computing NE, our proposed approach can be
parallelized and works with arbitrary learning rates, both firsts in
algorithmic game theory. Experimentally, we support our results by showing our
approach drastically outperforms standard methods.

### [10] [Better Regret Rates in Bilateral Trade via Sublinear Budget Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11419)
*Anna Lunghi,Matteo Castiglioni,Alberto Marchesi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了双边贸易中基于预算平衡约束的遗憾率问题，提出了一种算法在不同预算平衡约束下的最优遗憾率，并给出了匹配的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双边贸易是算法经济学的核心问题，现有研究表明在每步都强制执行预算平衡约束条件下无法实现无遗憾学习。论文旨在通过放松预算平衡约束为全局约束，研究遗憾率与预算平衡约束之间的权衡关系。

Method: 设计了一种算法，通过允许预算平衡约束的违反程度（$T^{\beta}$），在不同约束条件下实现最优遗憾率（$\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$），并提供了匹配的下界。

Result: 算法在预算平衡约束违反程度为$T^{\beta}$时，实现了$\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$的遗憾率，同时证明了该遗憾率的下界匹配，验证了Bernasconi等人的上下界结果是紧的。

Conclusion: 论文完全刻画了遗憾率与预算平衡约束违反程度之间的权衡关系，验证了现有研究的紧性，为双边贸易问题的算法设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Bilateral trade is a central problem in algorithmic economics, and recent
work has explored how to design trading mechanisms using no-regret learning
algorithms. However, no-regret learning is impossible when budget balance has
to be enforced at each time step. Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] show how this
impossibility can be circumvented by relaxing the budget balance constraint to
hold only globally over all time steps. In particular, they design an algorithm
achieving regret of the order of $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ and provide a lower bound
of $\Omega(T^{5/7})$.
  In this work, we interpolate between these two extremes by studying how the
optimal regret rate varies with the allowed violation of the global budget
balance constraint. Specifically, we design an algorithm that, by violating the
constraint by at most $T^{\beta}$ for any given $\beta \in [\frac{3}{4},
\frac{6}{7}]$, attains regret $\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$. We complement this
result with a matching lower bound, thus fully characterizing the trade-off
between regret and budget violation. Our results show that both the $\tilde
O(T^{3/4})$ upper bound in the global budget balance case and the
$\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound under unconstrained budget balance violation
obtained by Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] are tight.

### [11] [On the Complexity of the Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11509)
*Vincent Cheval,Florian Horn,Soumyajit Paul,Mahsa Shirmohammadi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在完美记忆的多玩家扩展形式游戏中，计算正常形式相关均衡（NFCE）的阈值问题的复杂度，证明其为PSPACE-hard，并揭示了与纳什均衡相比的复杂度反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法博弈论中的一个主要开放问题是，能否在简洁游戏（如扩展形式游戏）中高效计算正常形式相关均衡（NFCE）。本研究旨在解决这一问题的阈值版本。

Method: 通过分析扩展形式游戏中的相关均衡和纳什均衡的阈值问题，并建立其复杂度分类，包括证明NP-hard和NP-completeness。

Result: 研究证明，NFCE的阈值问题在完美记忆的多玩家扩展形式游戏中是PSPACE-hard，而对AFCE的阈值问题则证明为NP-hard。同时，对其他相关均衡概念也给出了严格的复杂度分类。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在扩展形式游戏中计算最优均衡的复杂度反转现象，并提供了迄今为止最完整的复杂度图谱。

Abstract: A major open question in algorithmic game theory is whether normal-form
correlated equilibria (NFCE) can be computed efficiently in succinct games such
as extensive-form games [DFF+25,6PR24,FP23,HvS08,VSF08,PR08]. Motivated by this
question, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there
exists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove
that this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games
with perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result,
we also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria
in this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising
complexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally
simpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in
extensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably
harder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by
[VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium
(EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult
the Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it
is NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our
hardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the
Threshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including
EFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse
correlated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer
stochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness
by providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results.
Together, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the
complexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.
