These methods are conceptually grounded in the abstract notion of a CuTe layout and a rich algebra of such layouts, including operations such as composition, logical product, and logical division. In this paper, we present a categorical framework for understanding this layout algebra by focusing on a naturally occurring class of tractable layouts. To this end, we define two categories Tuple and Nest whose morphisms give rise to layouts. We define a suite of operations on morphisms in these categories and prove their compatibility with the corresponding layout operations. Moreover, we give a complete characterization of the layouts which arise from our construction. Finally, we provide a Python implementation of our categorical constructions, along with tests that demonstrate alignment with CUTLASS behavior.

A natural question is whether standard sparse methods, such as $l_1$ relaxations and greedy pursuits, can reliably recover the optimal coalition structure in this setting. We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions. The concave sparsity penalty induced by SBL suppresses spurious near-duplicates and recovers the true coalition support with probability tending to one.

These often rely on heterogeneous sensing infrastructures and distinct routing algorithms, which can yield misaligned perceptions of the traffic environment and route preferences. While such technologies accelerate the transition toward increasingly intelligent transportation networks, their current deployment fails to avoid challenges associated with selfish routing behavior, in which drivers or automated agents prioritize individually optimal routes instead of network-wide congestion mitigation. Existing traffic flow management strategies can address leader-follower dynamics in traffic routing problems but are not designed to account for vehicles capable of dynamically switching between multiple operational modes. This paper models the interaction between a vehicle control arbitration system and a multi-modal vehicle as a repeated single-leader, multiple follower Stackelberg game with asymmetric information. To address the intractability of computing an exact solution in this setting, we propose a Trust-Aware Control Trading Strategy (TACTS) utilizing a regret matching-based algorithm to adaptively update the arbitration system's mixed strategy over sequential, dynamic routing decisions. Theoretical results provide bounds on the realized total network travel time under TACTS algorithm relative to the system-optimal total network travel time. Experimental results of simulations between the system and a vehicle in several real-world traffic networks under various different congestion levels demonstrate that TACTS consistently reduces network-wide congestion and generally outperforms alternative routing and control-allocation strategies, particularly under high congestion and heavy induced vehicle flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\uff08TACTS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u62e5\u5835\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8def\u7531\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u52a0\u5267\u62e5\u5835\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u5355\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3001\u591a\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u7684Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faTACTS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u61be\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cTACTS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u603b\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u62e5\u5835\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cTACTS\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u5835\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8def\u7531\u548c\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TACTS\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u9ad8\u8f66\u8f86\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u91cd\u578b\u8f66\u8f86\u6d41\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8def\u7531\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0cTACTS\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Existing optical motion capture systems rely on expensive camera setups and extensive manual post-processing, while low-cost vision-based methods often suffer from reduced accuracy and reliability under occlusion. To address these challenges, we present DexterCap, a low-cost optical capture system for dexterous in-hand manipulation. DexterCap uses dense, character-coded marker patches to achieve robust tracking under severe self-occlusion, together with an automated reconstruction pipeline that requires minimal manual effort. With DexterCap, we introduce DexterHand, a dataset of fine-grained hand-object interactions covering diverse manipulation behaviors and objects, from simple primitives to complex articulated objects such as a Rubik's Cube.

This approach formalizes the decision-making process of miners in Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems and enables a principled examination of block selection strategies as well as steady state analysis of the induced Markov chain. By leveraging a mean field game formulation, we efficiently characterize the information asymmetries that arise in asynchronous blockchain networks.\n  Our first main result is an exact characterization of the tradeoff between network delay and PoW efficiency--the fraction of blocks which end up in the longest chain. We demonstrate that the tradeoff observed in our model at steady state aligns closely with theoretical findings, validating our use of the mean field approximation.\n  Our second main result is a rigorous equilibrium analysis of the Longest Chain Rule (LCR). We show that the LCR is a mean field equilibrium and that it is uniquely optimal in maximizing PoW efficiency under certain mild assumptions. This result provides the first formal justification for continued use of the LCR in decentralized consensus protocols, offering both theoretical validation and practical insights.\n  Beyond these core results, our framework supports flexible experimentation with alternative block selection strategies, system dynamics, and reward structures. It offers a systematic and scalable substitute for expensive test-net deployments or ad hoc analysis.

Yet in practice, behavior often drifts, and detecting such deviations in real time remains an open challenge. We introduce a sequential testing framework that monitors whether observed play in repeated games is consistent with equilibrium, without assuming a fixed sample size. Our approach builds on the e-value framework for safe anytime-valid inference: by \"betting\" against equilibrium, we construct a test supermartingale that accumulates evidence whenever observed payoffs systematically violate equilibrium conditions. This yields a statistically sound, interpretable measure of departure from equilibrium that can be monitored online. We also leverage Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedures to increase detection power in large games while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our framework unifies the treatment of Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria, offering finite-time guarantees and a detailed analysis of detection times. Moreover, we extend our method to stochastic games, broadening its applicability beyond repeated-play settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u5747\u8861\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u56fa\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u5e38\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u79bb\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ee\u503c\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d85\u9785\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5bf9\u8d4c\u201d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u79ef\u7d2f\u8fdd\u80cc\u5747\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528Benjamini-Hochberg\u7c7b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5747\u8861\u504f\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u548c\u7c97\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}
