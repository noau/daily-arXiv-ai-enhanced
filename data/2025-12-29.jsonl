We propose a new paradigm based on resistance distance, derived from the graph Laplacian's spectrum, which better captures global graph structure. This approach overcomes theoretical and computational limitations of traditional methods, as resistance distance admits a natural isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Our experiments demonstrate improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. We introduce Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that integrates a fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This comprehensive random sampling strategy, enabled by efficient pre-computation of resistance distance embeddings, is more effective and robust than pivot-based sampling used in prior algorithms, consistently achieving lower and more stable stress values. The algorithm maintains $O(|E|)$ complexity for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our work establishes a connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing a practical and scalable solution for network visualization."}

Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models."}

This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market."}

A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for graphical valuations, where goods correspond to edges in a graph, agents to nodes, and each agent values only incident edges. The graph was required to be simple, i.e., for any pair of agents, there could be at most one good that both agents value. The problem remained open, however, for multi-graph valuations, where for a pair of agents several goods may have value to both. In this setting, Sgouritsa and Sotiriou [2025] established existence whenever the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least six, while Afshinmehr et al. [2025] proved existence when the graph contains no odd cycles. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that EFX allocations always exist in multi-graphs that contain no cycle of length three. Assuming monotone valuations, we further provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for computing such an allocation, which runs in polynomial time when agents have cancelable valuations, a strict superclass of additive valuation functions. Accordingly, our results stand as one of the only cases where EFX allocations exist for an arbitrary number of agents."}

Under a simple random \"sparse synergy\" model for coalition values, we prove that sparse relaxations recover coalition structures whose welfare is arbitrarily close to optimal in polynomial time with high probability. In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal."}

We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned."}

Owing to the observability of unconfirmed transactions, a strategic user can postpone his transaction broadcasting time and set a fee as low as possible by prying into his mempool that stores them. However, the stochastic mining interval may cause the delayed transaction to miss the next valid block. Meanwhile, a new feature (i.e. fee bumping) emerges that allows each user to increase his transaction fee before confirmation, making the fee setting more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a novel transaction policy from the perspective of a single strategic user that determines the broadcasting time and the transaction fee simultaneously. Two representative scenarios are considered, in which a number of coexisting ordinary users are mempool-oblivious that set their fees according to certain distribution, and are semi-strategic that check their mempools at a Poisson rate and update their fees. In the former, we compute the optimal broadcasting time and transaction fee that adapts to the arbitrary distribution of mining interval. When the block interval is exponentially distributed in Bitcoin-like PoW systems, the strategic user needs to broadcast his transaction immediately after its creation. And when the block interval is fixed in Ethereum-like PoS systems, he finds it profitable to wait until the last moment before block generation. In the latter, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of mempool states, and derive the optimal fee adjusting frequency of the strategic user when the block interval is exponentially distributed. In both theory and simulations, we show that this strategic user should immediately increase his fee whenever it falls behind the minimum fee of being included."}

Narahari"], "title": "Deep Learning Based Auction Design for Selling Agricultural Produce through Farmer Collectives to Maximize Nash Social Welfare", "comment": "12 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "This paper is motivated by the need to design a robust market mechanism to benefit farmers (producers of agricultural produce) as well as buyers of agricultural produce (consumers). Our proposal is a volume discount auction with a Farmer Collective (FC) as the selling agent and high volume or retail consumers as buying agents. An FC is a cooperative of farmers coming together to harness the power of aggregation and economies of scale. Our auction mechanism seeks to satisfy fundamental properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality, and an extremely relevant property for the agriculture setting, namely, Nash social welfare maximization. Besides satisfying these properties, our proposed auction mechanism also ensures that certain practical business constraints are met. Since an auction satisfying all of these properties exactly is a theoretical impossibility, we invoke the idea of designing deep learning networks that learn such an auction with minimal violation of the desired properties. The proposed auction, which we call VDA-SAP (Volume Discount Auction for Selling Agricultural Produce), is superior in many ways to the classical VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism in terms of richness of properties satisfied and further outperforms other baseline auctions as well. We demonstrate our results for a realistic setting of an FC selling perishable vegetables to potential buyers."}
