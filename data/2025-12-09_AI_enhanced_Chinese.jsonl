Each static analysis is based on a collection of abstract transformers that provide abstract semantics for the concrete instructions that make up a program. It can be challenging to implement abstract transformers that are sound, precise, and efficient, and in fact both LLVM and GCC have suffered from miscompilations caused by unsound abstract transformers. Moreover, even after more than 20 years of development, LLVM lacks abstract transformers for hundreds of instructions in its intermediate representation (IR). We developed NiceToMeetYou, a program synthesis framework for abstract transformers that are aimed at the kinds of non-relational integer abstract domains that are heavily used by today's production compilers. It exploits a simple but novel technique for breaking the synthesis problem into parts: each of our transformers is the meet of a collection of simpler, sound transformers that are synthesized such that each new piece fills a gap in the precision of the final transformer. Our design point is bulk automation: no sketches are required. Transformers are verified by lowering to a previously created SMT dialect of MLIR. Each of our synthesized transformers is provably sound and some (17 percent) are more precise than those provided by LLVM.", "AI": {"tldr": "NiceToMeetYou \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLVM \u7b49\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb8\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "NiceToMeetYou \u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5206\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8349\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 SMT \u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d17%\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u6bd4 LLVM \u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "NiceToMeetYou \u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u62bd\u8c61\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

To be published in CGO 2026", "summary": "Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Andersen\u5f0f\u6307\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728C\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u58f0\u97f3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u6307\u9488\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548cPIP\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6458\u8981\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6307\u9488\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PIP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u5f0f\u6307\u9488\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f7f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534715\u500d\uff0cPIP\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u901f1.9\u500d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534740%\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

This conflates policy performance with motion difficulty, obscuring whether failures stem from poor learning or inherently challenging motions. In this work, we address this gap with Motion Difficulty Score (MDS), a novel metric that defines and quantifies imitation difficulty independent of policy performance. Grounded in rigid-body dynamics, MDS interprets difficulty as the torque variation induced by small pose perturbations: larger torque-to-pose variation yields flatter reward landscapes and thus higher learning difficulty. MDS captures this through three properties of the perturbation-induced torque space: volume, variance, and temporal variability. We also use it to construct MD-AMASS, a difficulty-aware repartitioning of the AMASS dataset. Empirically, we rigorously validate MDS by demonstrating its explanatory power on the performance of state-of-the-art motion imitation policies.

The implications of these learning dynamics for market equilibrium and the conditions under which firms can effectively learn their true returns to scale are the key objects of this study. Our results shed light on how idiosyncratic shocks influence the learning process and demonstrate that input decisions encode all pertinent information for belief updates. Additionally, we show that a long-memory (path-dependent) learning which keeps track of all past estimations ends up having a worse performance than a short-memory (path-independent) approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u90e8\u95e8\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u5bf9\u89c4\u6a21\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8def\u5f84\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd0\u8425\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u5bf9\u89c4\u6a21\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u8def\u5f84\u65e0\u5173\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8f93\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u638c\u63e1\u771f\u5b9e\u89c4\u6a21\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u800c\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}
