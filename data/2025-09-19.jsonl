However, this\npotential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric\ninconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical\nuse in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or\nfine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,\ninference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step\nRecursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during\ninference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising\nstep to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned\nguidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and\nphotorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory\nconsistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play\nparadigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on\nleveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence."}

The paper has been accepted by\n  SIGCSE 2026", "summary": "While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools\noffer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We\npresent DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide\npersonalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a\npilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of\nthe system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered\nconstructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback\nquality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective\nafter using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through\nscaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and\nsome students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings\nsuggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems\nprogramming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our\nstudy highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to\nsupport personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging\nprogramming domains."}

It offers insights into\ncollective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural\nNetworks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a\nweighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging\nprocess, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual\nminimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to\nan equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds\non the \"price of anarchy\" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at\nequilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala\n(STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and\nprovided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.\n  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented\nas a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a\nmultidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant\ninterdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy\nfor this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the\nmultidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex\ninterdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we\nprovide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties.\nSurprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that\nthe bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity,\ninvolving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external\ndisagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios."}

We claim that SMT solvers, when seamlessly\nintegrated into a compiler's static checks, significantly enhance the\ncapabilities of ordinary type checkers in program composition. Specifically, we\nargue that refinement types, as embodied by Liquid Haskell, enable the use of\nSMT solvers in mundane programming tasks. Through a case study on handling\nbinder scopes in compilers, we envision a future where ordinary programming is\nmade simpler and more enjoyable with the aid of refinement types and SMT\nsolvers. As a secondary contribution, we present a prototype implementation of\na theory of finite maps for Liquid Haskell's solver, developed to support our\ncase study."}

Agents learn preferences via\nstochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use\nin labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be\nmatched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable\nmanner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable\nmatching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity\nfor (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true\npreferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We\npropose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically\n($\\delta\\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning.\nUsing the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the\ntwo-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it\nclosely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system\nof ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases."}
