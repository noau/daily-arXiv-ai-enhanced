Inspired by the human ability to leverage past observations for interpreting ongoing actions, we propose FrameCache, a training-free three-stage framework consisting of Screen, Cache, and Match. In the Screen stage, a multi-dimensional, quality-aware mechanism with adaptive thresholds dynamically selects informative frames; the Cache stage maintains a reference pool using a dynamic replacement-hit strategy, preserving both diversity and relevance; and the Match stage extracts behavioral features to perform motion-consistent reference matching for coherent animation guidance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FrameCache consistently improves temporal coherence and visual stability while integrating seamlessly with diverse baselines. Despite these encouraging results, further analysis reveals that its effectiveness depends on baseline temporal reasoning and real-synthetic consistency, motivating future work on compatibility conditions and adaptive cache mechanisms. Code will be made publicly available."}

Among the factors contributing to this effect are the properties of urban materials, which differ from those in rural areas. To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D."}

By learning extrusion sequences that assemble a mesh, similar to the way artists create meshes, our approach naturally supports arbitrary output face counts and produces manifold meshes by design, in contrast to recent transformer-based models. The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions. We demonstrate that our representation enables reconstruction, novel shape synthesis, and the addition of new features to existing meshes."}

In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI."}

Shelling's theory explains how, in these settings, humans coordinate by relying on focal points: solutions or outcomes that naturally arise because they stand out in some way as salient or prominent to all players. This work studies Large Language Models (LLMs) as players in tacit coordination games, and addresses how, when, and why focal points emerge. We compare and quantify the coordination capabilities of LLMs in cooperative and competitive games for which human experiments are available. We also introduce several learning-free strategies to improve the coordination of LLMs, with themselves and with humans. On a selection of heterogeneous open-source models, including Llama, Qwen, and GPT-oss, we discover that LLMs have a remarkable capability to coordinate and often outperform humans, yet fail on common-sense coordination that involves numbers or nuanced cultural archetypes. This paper constitutes the first large-scale assessment of LLMs' tacit coordination within the theoretical and psychological framework of focal points."}

We introduce FairFormer, an amortized, permutation-equivariant two-tower transformer that encodes items and agents as unordered token sets, applies self-attention within each set, and uses item-to-agent cross-attention to produce per-item assignment distributions in a single forward pass. FairFormer is trained end-to-end to maximize expected log-Nash welfare on sampled instances, requiring no solver supervision, unrolled allocation procedures, or fairness labels. At test time, we discretize by row-wise $\\arg\\max$ and apply a lightweight post-processing routine that transfers items to eliminate violations of envy-freeness up to one item while prioritizing improvements in Nash welfare. Our approach generalizes beyond its training regime and achieves near-optimal welfare (e.g., for uniformly sampled valuations, $96$--$97\\%$ for Nash welfare; $95$--$96\\%$ for utilitarian welfare), outperforming strong baselines in solution quality and/or runtime."}

Parkes"], "title": "Dynamic Welfare-Maximizing Pooled Testing", "comment": null, "summary": "Pooled testing is a common strategy for public health disease screening under limited testing resources, allowing multiple biological samples to be tested together with the resources of a single test, at the cost of reduced individual resolution. While dynamic and adaptive strategies have been extensively studied in the classical pooled testing literature, where the goal is to minimize the number of tests required for full diagnosis of a given population, much of the existing work on welfare-maximizing pooled testing adopts static formulations in which all tests are assigned in advance. In this paper, we study dynamic welfare-maximizing pooled testing strategies in which a limited number of tests are performed sequentially to maximize social welfare, defined as the aggregate utility of individuals who are confirmed to be healthy. We formally define the dynamic problem and study algorithmic approaches for sequential test assignment. Because exact dynamic optimization is computationally infeasible beyond small instances, we evaluate a range of strategies (including exact optimization baselines, greedy heuristics, mixed-integer programming relaxations, and learning-based policies) and empirically characterize their performance and tradeoffs using synthetic experiments. Our results show that dynamic testing can yield substantial welfare improvements over static baselines in low-budget regimes. We find that much of the benefit of dynamic testing is captured by simple greedy policies, which substantially outperform static approaches while remaining computationally efficient. Learning-based methods are included as flexible baselines, but in our experiments they do not reliably improve upon these heuristics. Overall, this work provides a principled computational perspective on dynamic pooled testing and clarifies when dynamic assignment meaningfully improves welfare in public health screening."}

An Ecosystem Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The integration of AI Overviews into search engines enhances user experience but diverts traffic from content creators, potentially discouraging high-quality content creation and causing user attrition that undermines long-term search engine profit. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic model of creator competition with costly effort, characterize equilibrium behavior, and design two incentive mechanisms: a citation mechanism that references sources within an AI Overview, and a compensation mechanism that offers monetary rewards to creators. For both cases, we provide structural insights and near-optimal profit-maximizing mechanisms. Evaluations on real click data show that although AI Overviews harm long-term search engine profit, interventions based on our proposed mechanisms can increase long-term profit across a range of realistic scenarios, pointing toward a more sustainable trajectory for AI-enhanced search ecosystems."}

Given the size and complexity of most communication networks, each entity typically only has a local view and thus must rely on a local routing protocol for sending and forwarding packets. A common solution for this is greedy routing, where packets are locally forwarded to a neighbor in the network that is closer to the packet's destination.\n  In this paper we investigate a game-theoretic model with autonomous agents that aim at forming a network where greedy routing is enabled. The agents are positioned in a metric space and each agent tries to establish as few links as possible, while maintaining that it can reach every other agent via greedy routing. Thus, this model captures how greedy routing networks are formed without any assumption on the distribution of the agents or the specific employed greedy routing protocol. Hence, it distills the essence that makes greedy routing work.\n  We study two variants of the model: with directed edges or with undirected edges. For the former, we show that equilibria exist, have optimal total cost, and that in Euclidean metrics they can be found efficiently. However, even for this simple setting computing optimal strategies is NP-hard. For the much more challenging setting with undirected edges, we show for the realistic setting with agents in 2D Euclidean space that the price of anarchy is between 1.75 and 1.8 and for higher dimensions it is less than 2. Also, we show that best response dynamics may cycle, but that in Euclidean space almost optimal approximate equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, for 2D Euclidean space, these approximate equilibria outperform the well-known Delaunay triangulation."}

However, despite decades of research on its convergence in constrained optimization -- and potential games in particular -- its behavior remained hitherto poorly understood. In this paper, we establish that FTRL can take exponential time to converge to a Nash equilibrium in two-player potential games for any (permutation-invariant) regularizer and potentially vanishing learning rate. By known equivalences, this translates to an exponential lower bound for certain mirror descent counterparts, most notably multiplicative weights update. On the positive side, we establish the potential property for FTRL and obtain an exponential upper bound $\\exp(O_ε(1/ε^2))$ for any no-regret dynamics executed in a lazy, alternating fashion, matching our lower bound up to factors in the exponent. Finally, in multi-player potential games, we show that fictitious play -- the extreme version of FTRL -- can take doubly exponential time to reach a Nash equilibrium. This constitutes an exponentially stronger lower bound for the foundational learning algorithm in games."}
