Material coating is fundamentally different from existing \"material transfer\" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task."}

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20"}

Matthew Weinberg"], "title": "Characterizing Off-Chain Influence Proof Transaction Fee Mechanisms", "comment": null, "summary": "Roughgarden (2020) initiates the study of Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs), and posits that the on-chain game of a ``good'' TFM should be on-chain simple (OnCS), i.e., incentive compatible for users and the miner. Recent work of Ganesh, Thomas and Weinberg (2024) posits that they should additionally be Off-Chain Influence Proof (OffCIP), which means that the miner cannot achieve any additional revenue by separately conducting an off-chain auction to determine on-chain inclusion. They observe that a cryptographic second-price auction satisfies both properties, but leave open the question of whether other mechanisms (e.g, non-cryptographic) satisfy these properties.\n  In this paper, we characterize OffCIP TFMs: They are those satisfying a burn identity relating the burn rule to the allocation rule. In particular, we show that auction is OffCIP if and only if its (induced direct-revelation) allocation rule $\\bar{X}(\\cdot)$ and burn rule $\\bar{B}(\\cdot)$ (both of which take as input users' values $v_1, \\dots, v_n$) are truthful when viewing $\\big(\\bar{X}(\\cdot), \\bar{B}(\\cdot)\\big)$ as the allocation and pricing rule of a multi-item auction for a single additive buyer with values $\\big(\\varphi(v_1),\\ldots, \\varphi(v_n)\\big)$ equal to the users' virtual values.\n  Building on this burn identity, we characterize deterministic OffCIP and OnCS TFMs that do not use cryptography: They are posted-price mechanisms with specially-tuned burns. As a corollary, we show that such TFMs can only exist with infinite supply and prior-dependence. However, we show that for randomized TFMs, there are additional OnCS and OffCIP auctions that do not use cryptography (even when there is finite supply, under prior-dependence with a bounded prior distribution). Holistically, our results show that while OffCIP is a fairly stringent requirement, families of OffCIP mechanisms can be found for a variety of settings."}

However, they are hard to program, leading developers to use vendor-provided kernel libraries that support tensor accelerators. As a result, the usage of tensor accelerators is limited to the provided interface, mainly designed for traditional ML and scientific computing workloads.\n  In this paper, we show that tensor accelerators can improve the performance of applications beyond simple variants of MatMul. For example, many image processing pipelines are linear transformations over matrices in disguise and can therefore utilize such specialized hardware. This is nonetheless hindered by the difficulties in programming tensor accelerators. We tackle this problem with compiler-based techniques. We use the Halide user-schedulable language and express operations as Halide algorithms succinctly. To this end, we implement a flexible tensor instruction selector based on equality saturation. The tensor instruction selector supports both CPU- and GPU-attached tensor accelerators and works with existing scheduling operations (e.g., producer-consumer fusion). Together, this enables developers to write diverse accelerator-leveraging applications in a few dozen lines.\n  Using our system, we demonstrate the potential of tensor accelerators beyond their traditional domains. We implement several image processing pipelines (e.g., filtering, resampling, and denoising) in our system and evaluate them against non-accelerator-leveraging baselines. We show that these pipelines can achieve significant speedups. For example, a downsampling routine is sped up by $6.1\\times$ by utilizing Tensor Cores on an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU."}

To manage the uncertainty inherent in online settings, PPMs commonly employ dynamically increasing prices. While this adaptive pricing achieves strong performance, it introduces practical challenges: dynamically changing prices can lead to fairness concerns stemming from price discrimination and incur operational costs associated with frequent updates. This paper addresses these issues by investigating posted pricing constrained by a limited, pre-specified number of allowed price changes, denoted by $Δ$. We further extend this framework by incorporating a second critical dimension: risk sensitivity. Instead of evaluating performance based solely on expectation, we utilize a tail-risk objective-specifically, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of the total social welfare, parameterized by a risk level $δ\\in [0, 1]$.\n  We formally introduce a novel problem class kSelection-$(δ,Δ)$ in online adversarial selection and propose a correlated PPM that utilizes a single random seed to correlate posted prices. This correlation scheme is designed to address both the limited price changes and simultaneously enhance the tail performance of the online algorithm. Our subsequent analysis provides performance guarantees under these joint constraints, revealing a clear trade-off between the number of allowed price changes and the algorithm's risk sensitivity. We also establish optimality results for several important special cases of the problem."}

Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates."}

While general non-zero-sum games are computationally hard, researchers focus on the special class of monotone games for gradient-based algorithms. However, there is a substantial gap between the gradient complexity of monotone zero-sum and monotone general-sum games. Moreover, in many practical scenarios of games the zero-sum assumption needs to be relaxed. To address these issues, we define a new intermediate class of monotone near-zero-sum games that contains monotone zero-sum games as a special case. Then, we present a novel algorithm that transforms the near-zero-sum games into a sequence of zero-sum subproblems, improving the gradient-based complexity for the class. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this new class to model practical scenarios of games motivated from the literature."}

Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS. It offers a structured view of prompt distributions via graphs, forming random prompts from sampled subgraphs. Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS. Lumos is the first systematic and extensible language-based framework for specifying and certifying LMS behaviors, paving the way for a wider adoption of LMS certification."}
