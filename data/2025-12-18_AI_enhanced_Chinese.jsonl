To appear in IEEE TVCG", "summary": "We propose Probabilistic Inclusion Depth (PID) for the ensemble visualization of scalar fields. By introducing a probabilistic inclusion operator $\\subset_{\\!p}$, our method is a general data depth model supporting ensembles of fuzzy contours, such as soft masks from modern segmentation methods, and conventional ensembles of binary contours. We also advocate to extend contour extraction in scalar field ensembles to become a fuzzy decision by considering the probabilistic distribution of an isovalue to encode the sensitivity information. To reduce the complexity of the data depth computation, an efficient approximation using the mean probabilistic contour is devised. Furthermore, an order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved with an efficient parallel algorithm on the GPU. Our new method enables the computation of contour boxplots for ensembles of probabilistic masks, ensembles defined on various types of grids, and large 3D ensembles that are not studied by existing methods. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques on synthetic datasets, through examples of real-world ensemble datasets, and expert feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u5305\u542b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08PID\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u7cca\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7GPU\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u5927\u578b3D\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u5305\u542b\u7b97\u5b50$\u2283_{\\!p}$\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u7cca\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u503c\u6982\u7387\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "PID\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u578b3D\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PID\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u6846\u67b6JEANet\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u5168\u7403\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7ade\u4ef7\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u5168\u7403\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7ade\u4ef7\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u6846\u67b6JEANet\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AMD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7684\u7ade\u4ef7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u62cd\u5356\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJEANet\u5728\u591a\u69fd\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "JEANet\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5168\u7403\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u7684AMD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7ade\u4ef7\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u62cd\u5356\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute.\n  An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface.\n  We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u62bd\u8c61\"\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\"\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0ePython\u7b49\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Nightjar\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728Nightjar\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7f16\u5199\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u7136\u4ee3\u7801\u7684Python\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "Nightjar\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51fa4-19%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1139.6%\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a00.4-4.3\u500d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9700\u8981\u6743\u8861\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
