However, such games are known for\nfailing to admit exact equilibria and also the assumption of all players being\nable to solve nonconvex problems to global optimality is questionable. This\nmotivates the study of approximate equilibria. In this work, we consider an\napproximation concept that incorporates both multiplicative and additive\nrelaxations of optimality. We propose a branch-and-cut (B&C) method that\ncomputes such approximate equilibria or proves its non-existence. For this, we\nadopt the idea of intersection cuts and show the existence of such cuts under\nthe condition that the constraints are linear and each player's cost function\nis either convex in the entire strategy profile, or, concave in the entire\nstrategy profile and linear in the rivals' strategies. For the special case of\nstandard Nash equilibrium problems, we introduce an alternative type of cut and\nshow that the method terminates finitely, provided that each player has only\nfinitely many distinct best-response sets. Finally, on the basis of the B&C\nmethod, we introduce a single-tree binary-search method to compute\nbest-approximate equilibria under some simplifying assumptions.
