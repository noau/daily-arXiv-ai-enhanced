Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms\nfor checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists.

In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\"). We observe that for protocols relying on behavioral assumptions\n(e.g., ledgers), our goal is unattainable in full generality. For\nstate-of-the-world assumptions, we show that standard solution concepts, e.g.,\n($\\epsilon$-)Nash equilibria, are not robust to transfer from the ideal to the\nreal world.\n  We propose a new solution concept: the pseudo-Nash equilibrium.

Starting from an increasing\nsequence of inaccessible cardinals, we give an inductive-recursive definition\nof universe codes, their decoding functor, and a rank that controls the growth\nof each code. For every level of the tower we prove closure under dependent\nproducts, dependent sums, identity types, and all finite limits and colimits;\nthe colimit part is obtained with a rank-stable quotient constructor. A\nuniverse-lifting operation shows strict cumulativity across levels. Assuming\npropositional resizing at one level, we construct an explicit left adjoint to\nthe inclusion of minus-one truncated types and show that resizing automatically\nlifts to every higher level. These ingredients combine in an Existence Theorem\nstating that, over Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the chosen inaccessible\ncardinals, the tower delivers a sound set-theoretic model of higher type\ntheory.

This idea extends to\n$\\alpha$-undominated sets, which ensure the same property for any\n$\\alpha$-fraction of voters and are guaranteed to exist in constant size for\nany $\\alpha$. However, the requirement that an outsider be preferred to every\nmember of the set can be overly restrictive and difficult to justify in many\napplications. Motivated by this, we introduce a more flexible notion: $(t,\n\\alpha)$-undominated sets. Here, each voter compares an outsider to their\n$t$-th most preferred member of the set, and the set is undominated if no\noutsider is preferred by more than an $\\alpha$-fraction of voters. This\nframework subsumes prior definitions, recovering Condorcet winning sets when\n$(t = 1, \\alpha = 1/2)$ and $\\alpha$-undominated sets when $t = 1$, and\nintroduces a new, tunable notion of collective acceptability for $t > 1$.

Inspired by the remarkable\nsuccess of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this\npaper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR)\nspecifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines\nGaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute\nscattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images\nthrough SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and\nthe ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive\nparameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is\nemployed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient\ncomputation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified\narchitectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate\nthe imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the\neffectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both\nsimulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with\nquantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance.\nExperimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the\ngeometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a\nnovel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging."}
