### [1] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成全景图像拼接的方法，通过微调扩散模型来克服传统方法和现有生成模型在拼接含视差和光线变化的图像时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像拼接方法在处理含视差和光线变化的图像时会产生重影等伪影，而现有生成模型无法合成大范围连贯的全景图。

Method: 该方法通过微调基于扩散的图像修复模型，以保留多参考图像的内容和布局，然后从单张参考图像生成无缝的全景图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和场景布局一致性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法能够生成无缝且视觉连贯的全景图，并忠实整合多参考图像的内容，解决了传统方法和现有生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

### [2] [LangSplatV2: High-dimensional 3D Language Gaussian Splatting with 450+ FPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07136)
*Wanhua Li,Yujie Zhao,Minghan Qin,Yang Liu,Yuanhao Cai,Chuang Gan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LangSplatV2 是一种高效的高维特征点渲染方法，速度提升显著并支持3D开放词汇文本查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法LangSplat在复杂场景中语言交互的应用中性能不足（8.2 FPS），限制了广泛应用。

Method: LangSplatV2 通过学习3D稀疏系数场，完全消除对重型解码器的依赖，并采用CUDA优化的稀疏系数渲染方法。

Result: LangSplatV2 在高分辨率图像上实现476.2 FPS的高维特征渲染和384.6 FPS的3D文本查询，速度提升42倍和47倍，同时提高了查询准确性。

Conclusion: LangSplatV2 在保持或超越查询准确性的同时，显著提升了性能，推动了3D语言交互应用的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional
feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6
FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 $\times$ speedup and a 47
$\times$ boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.
LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into
3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with
SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for
applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,
LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even
with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this
paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the
heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2
assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary,
leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely
eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we
further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA
optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while
incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or
competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster. Codes and demos
are available at our project page: https://langsplat-v2.github.io.

### [4] [Self-supervised Learning of Latent Space Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07440)
*Yue Li,Gene Wei-Chin Lin,Egor Larionov,Aljaz Bozic,Doug Roble,Ladislav Kavan,Stelian Coros,Bernhard Thomaszewski,Tuur Stuyck,Hsiao-yu Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经潜在空间积分器的新型子空间模拟框架，用于高效模拟可变形物体的动态行为，特别适合便携设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟方法计算成本高昂，子空间模拟虽能提高性能但仍无法满足便携设备的严格要求。因此，研究团队提出了一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 论文采用了一种基于自监督学习的神经潜在空间积分器，完全在潜在空间内操作，无需全空间计算，从而大幅提升效率。

Result: 该方法在涉及杆状、壳状和固体物体的复杂示例中表现优异，展示了其多功能性和广泛应用潜力。

Conclusion: 通过结合子空间模拟和神经潜在空间积分器，论文提出了一种高效且通用的方法，适用于便携设备，为动态行为模拟开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamic behavior of deformable objects is crucial for creating
realistic digital worlds. While conventional simulations produce high-quality
motions, their computational costs are often prohibitive. Subspace simulation
techniques address this challenge by restricting deformations to a
lower-dimensional space, improving performance while maintaining visually
compelling results. However, even subspace methods struggle to meet the
stringent performance demands of portable devices such as virtual reality
headsets and mobile platforms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel subspace simulation framework powered by a neural latent-space
integrator. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to enhance
inference stability and generalization. By operating entirely within latent
space, our method eliminates the need for full-space computations, resulting in
a highly efficient method well-suited for deployment on portable devices. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging examples involving
rods, shells, and solids, showcasing its versatility and potential for
widespread adoption.

### [5] [SD-GS: Structured Deformable 3D Gaussians for Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07465)
*Wei Yao,Shuzhao Xie,Letian Li,Weixiang Zhang,Zhixin Lai,Shiqi Dai,Ke Zhang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SD-GS是一种紧凑高效的高斯泼溅框架，用于复杂动态场景重建，通过引入可变形锚点网格和变形感知的密集化策略，显著减少了模型大小并提高了渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的4D高斯框架在动态场景重建中虽具有高视觉保真度和快速渲染的优势，但在存储成本与复杂物理运动表征之间存在固有折衷，限制了其实际应用。

Method: SD-GS通过引入可变形锚点网格作为层次化和内存高效的场景表示，以及变形感知的密集化策略，优化了动态区域的建模并减少了静态区域的冗余。

Result: 实验表明，SD-GS相比现有方法平均减少了60%的模型大小，并提升了100%的FPS，同时在视觉质量上保持一致甚至更优。

Conclusion: SD-GS在提高计算效率的同时，显著提升了动态场景重建的实用性，为复杂动态场景的处理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

### [6] [Capture Stage Environments: A Guide to Better Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07623)
*Hannah Dröge,Janelle Pfeifer,Saskia Rabich,Markus Plack,Reinhard Klein,Matthias B. Hullin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了捕获阶段内容在图像抠图中的独特挑战，并提出了改进工作流程的指南，同时展示了一种无需大量标注的高效管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捕获阶段的高端录制内容在电影、游戏等媒体中有广泛应用，但现有抠图算法难以应对其独特性，因此需要针对这些挑战提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分析捕获阶段内容的特性，提出改进工作流程，并设计了一种高效管道以适应定制设置，无需大量标注。此外，还提出了一种基于扩散模型的客观评估方法。

Result: 研究表明，所提出的方法能够有效应对捕获阶段内容的抠图挑战，并在离线及实时环境中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文不仅为实践中遇到的抠图问题提供了解决方案，还为未来研究提供了参考，强调了定制化工作流程的重要性。

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

### [7] [RTR-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering with Radiance Transfer and Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07733)
*Yongyang Zhou,Fang-Lue Zhang,Zichen Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RTR-GS是一种新颖的逆渲染框架，能够处理任意反射属性的对象，分解BRDF和光照，并提供可信的重新光照结果。该方法通过结合前向渲染和延迟渲染，有效恢复几何结构并分离高频和低频外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文针对3D高斯喷溅（3DGS）在处理反射物体时的不足，特别是逆渲染和重新光照方面的挑战，提出了一种新的解决方案。

Method: RTR-GS结合了前向渲染和延迟渲染的混合渲染模型，用于恢复几何结构和分离高频和低频外观。此外，还利用基于物理的延迟渲染分支优化BRDF和光照分解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在增强新视图合成、法线估计、分解和重新光照方面表现出色，同时还保持了高效的训练和推理过程。

Conclusion: RTR-GS是一种有效的逆渲染框架，能够处理复杂的反射物体问题，并在多个任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

### [8] [Hi-d maps: An interactive visualization technique for multi-dimensional categorical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07890)
*Radi Muhammad Reza,Benjamin A Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Hi-D maps 是一种新的多维分类数据可视化方法，通过在二维规则多边形区域中分层映射高维数据，并结合多种视觉线索和交互功能，有效展示信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高维数据可视化技术较少，尤其是在有效和节省空间的方式下展示大量数据维度。Hi-D maps 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将高维数据映射到二维规则多边形区域，通过分层切割多边形并使用视觉线索（如方向、厚度、颜色、可计数符号和文本）展示跨维度信息，同时提供交互和分层浏览功能。

Result: Hi-D maps 能够清晰展示高维数据，并支持灵活的交互探索，但在维度过多时效果会减弱。

Conclusion: Hi-D maps 提供了一种有效的高维数据可视化方法，适用于多维度信息的展示和交互探索，尤其在维度数量未超过感知极限时效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Hi-D maps, a novel method for the visualization of
multi-dimensional categorical data. Our work addresses the scarcity of
techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective
and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D
regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel
to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension.
We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color,
countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have
added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible
exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus,
our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our
glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many
visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of
dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before
those limits are reached.

### [9] [On Propositional Program Equivalence (extended abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07480)
*Tobias Kappé*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了命题程序等价性，特别是基于(G)KAT视角的最新进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 普通程序等价性是不可判定的，但通过抽象语句的语义，命题等价性不仅是可判定的，而且实际可行。

Method: 研究采用了(Guarded) Kleene Algebra with Tests ((G)KAT)的视角来探讨命题程序等价性。

Result: 通过(G)KAT方法，可以有效地分析和验证命题程序的等价性。

Conclusion: 这一研究为命题程序等价性提供了新的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

*Yang Li,Yuchao Ma,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个优化的联合广告机制，包括单广告位的最优机制和多广告位的BundleNet神经网络方法，显著提高了平台收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合广告机制由于过于关注单个广告主而忽视了广告组合结构，无法实现最优分配效率和收入提升。

Method: 在单广告位场景中提出最优机制；在多广告位场景中设计BundleNet神经网络方法，专门用于联合广告。

Result: 实验表明，BundleNet生成的机制在单广告位场景中接近理论分析结果，在多广告位场景中达到最优性能，显著增加收入并满足激励兼容性和个体合理性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的机制和BundleNet方法在联合广告中表现出色，能够有效提升平台收益和分配效率。

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

Result: 仿真结果显示，RA-ABC和RA-ABCDR优于传统方法，RA-ABCDR用户保留率提高54.6\%，拍卖成本降低22.2\%，系统性能在稳定性、公平性和成本效率方面均显著提升。

Conclusion: RA-ABC和RA-ABCDR通过优化投标和动态招募机制，显著提升了MCS系统的效率和可持续性，为未来的研究和实际应用提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is the mechanism wherein people can contribute in
data collection process using their own mobile devices which have sensing
capabilities. Incentives are rewards that individuals get in exchange for data
they submit. Reverse Auction Bidding (RAB) is a framework that allows users to
place bids for selling the data they collected. Task providers can select users
to buy data from by looking at bids. Using the RAB framework, MCS system can be
optimized for better user utility, task provider utility and platform utility.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Reverse Auction with Assumed
Bid Cost (RA-ABC) which allows users to place a bid in the system before
collecting data. We opine that performing the tasks only after winning helps in
reducing resource consumption instead of performing the tasks before bidding.
User Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated with which they decide to further
participate or not by either increasing or decreasing their bids. We also
propose an extension of RA-ABC with dynamic recruitment (RA-ABCDR) in which we
allow new users to join the system at any time during bidding rounds.
Simulation results demonstrate that RA-ABC and RA-ABCDR outperform the widely
used Tullock Optimal Prize Function, with RA-ABCDR achieving up to 54.6\%
higher user retention and reducing auction cost by 22.2\%, thereby ensuring
more efficient and sustainable system performance. Extensive simulations
confirm that dynamic user recruitment significantly enhances performance across
stability, fairness, and cost-efficiency metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告模型和联合广告各自吸引不同的用户群体，导致点击率较低。为了克服这一限制并提高广告的普适性，论文提出了混合广告模型。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的混合广告模型，并通过Hybrid Regret Network（HRegNet）设计最优拍卖机制，确保策略激励兼容性和个体合理性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验表明，HRegNet生成的机制比现有基线方法显著提高了平台收入。

Conclusion: 混合广告模型及其优化机制HRegNet在广告投放中表现出色，为平台带来了更高的收入。

Abstract: Online advertisements are a primary revenue source for e-commerce platforms.
Traditional advertising models are store-centric, selecting winning stores
through auction mechanisms. Recently, a new approach known as joint advertising
has emerged, which presents sponsored bundles combining one store and one brand
in ad slots. Unlike traditional models, joint advertising allows platforms to
collect payments from both brands and stores. However, each of these two
advertising models appeals to distinct user groups, leading to low
click-through rates when users encounter an undesirable advertising model. To
address this limitation and enhance generality, we propose a novel advertising
model called ''Hybrid Advertising''. In this model, each ad slot can be
allocated to either an independent store or a bundle. To find the optimal
auction mechanisms in hybrid advertising, while ensuring nearly dominant
strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality, we introduce the
Hybrid Regret Network (HRegNet), a neural network architecture designed for
this purpose. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data
demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by HRegNet significantly improve
platform revenue compared to established baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于通过机器学习预测改进协调机制，以优化社交成本并应对预测不准确的情况。

Method: 采用机器学习预测提供简单建议输入率的方法，设计协调机制，并分析其一致性和鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，在预测准确时能优化社交成本（一致性），预测不准确时损失最小（有界鲁棒性）；机制在所有单调成本函数下一致且鲁棒性最优。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一种在预测误差范围内平滑退化的鲁棒机制，并为其设置了误差容忍阈值。

Abstract: We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine
cost functions. We investigate the power of machine-learned predictions in the
design of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of
selfishness. Our main results demonstrate that enhancing coordination
mechanisms with a simple advice on the input rate can optimize the social cost
whenever the advice is accurate (consistency), while only incurring minimal
losses even when the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate (bounded
robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent
mechanisms that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our
suggested mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness. We further
explore the notion of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism
to achieve error-tolerance, i.e. we provide an approximation guarantee that
degrades smoothly as a function of the prediction error, up to a predetermined
threshold, while achieving a bounded robustness.
