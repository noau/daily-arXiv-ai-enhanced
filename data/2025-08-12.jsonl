Our\nrepresentation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and\nBRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials.\n  We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution\nis modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance\nsampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term,\ncaptured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar\npdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions.\n  We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered\nmaterials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other\nmicrostructures."}

Each handler\nhas a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint\nthat the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by\ndifferent handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is\nchecking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of\nevent-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for\neventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as\nexecution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational\nsemantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,\nresulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given\ntrace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem\nand show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is\nbounded.

However, existing research has predominantly\nfocused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from\nan interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where\nparticipation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game\nmodel to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and\ncooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In\nthe pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once\nin the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on\nthe formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation\nboosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead\nto widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare\ntwo institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that\nrewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible\none (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the\ngame. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better\nfor promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an\nopportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient\nalternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour\nresults in a high gain.
