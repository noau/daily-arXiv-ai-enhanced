### [1] [B-repLer: Semantic B-rep Latent Editor using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10201)
*Yilin Liu,Niladri Shekhar Dutt,Changjian Li,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将多模态大语言模型（mLLMs）适配于边界表示（B-rep）CAD对象的高级编辑任务，提出了B-repLer模型，并通过自动生成数据集的方法解决了3D数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管mLLMs在多种任务中表现优异，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是B-rep CAD对象的编辑。这主要是由于缺乏合适的标注3D数据以及3D表示的特殊性。研究旨在验证mLLMs是否能够支持B-rep CAD对象的高级编辑。

Method: 提出了B-repLer模型，这是一种经过微调的mLLM，能够理解文本提示并对给定的B-rep进行语义编辑，生成有效输出。通过设计一种新颖的多模态架构来处理B-rep模型，并利用现有CAD工具自动生成所需的推理数据集。

Result: B-repLer能够实现多种复杂度的基于文本的B-rep编辑，这在之前是不可能的。实验结果表明，该方法在无需外部标注的情况下，能够有效地完成B-rep编辑任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明，mLLMs可以通过B-repLer模型成功支持B-rep CAD对象的高级编辑，解决了3D数据不足的问题，并为未来的3D编辑任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

Method: 作者提出了一个通用核心结构——设备状态机，用于抽象QMR问题，并设计了一种领域特定语言Marol来定义QMR问题。通过Marol，可以生成参数化求解器，适用于任意Marol程序。

Result: 通过案例研究，本文证明了生成的编译器在运行时间和解决方案质量上与手工编写的专用编译器相当，适用于嘈杂和容错的量子架构。

Conclusion: 本文的方法为未来量子编译器开发提供了简化途径，有望随着量子架构的不断演进而发挥作用。

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

### [3] [FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129)
*Jiehua Chen,Sanjukta Roy,Sofia Simola*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了稳定匹配相关的三个优化问题的参数化近似性，并证明了部分问题的W[1]-硬性和FPT近似方案的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稳定匹配问题的参数化近似性，探索其计算的可行性和优化方法。

Method: 分析三个优化问题的NP硬性和W[1]-硬性，并尝试设计FPT近似方案。

Result: 前两个问题在参数β下无法近似到任何函数的程度，第三个问题针对具有约束的代理人数提出了FPT近似方案。

Conclusion: 部分稳定匹配问题具有较高的计算复杂性，但通过参数化方法可以找到有效的近似方案。

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

Conclusion: 通过博弈论模型和双oracle框架，论文提供了一种在对抗环境中高效且难以预测的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested
environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen
route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal
routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans
are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit
their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the
route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately
deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although
solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle
framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,
making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is
modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We
evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively
to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling
the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept
both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and
electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic
voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models.
However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a
carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the
computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even
approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more
players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from
poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or
lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose
a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial
complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial
branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative
analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show
the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of
computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.
