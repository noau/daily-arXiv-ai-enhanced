We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based\nverifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers\nrepresent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage\nover UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp\ndifferences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open\nchallenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and\nBest-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances\nraises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%,\nand Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%."}

We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in\na regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer\narrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible\nand individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.\n  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer\nvaluations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown\ndistribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret\nin the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an\nadversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best\nincentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us\nfrom previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the\nbenchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.\n  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all\nmechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful\nchaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism\nat (essentially) optimal rate.
