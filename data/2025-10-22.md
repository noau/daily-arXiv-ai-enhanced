*Bing Xu,Mukund Varma T,Cheng Wang,Tzumao Li,Lifan Wu,Bartlomiej Wronski,Ravi Ramamoorthi,Marco Salvi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D场景配置的可泛化全局光照嵌入方法，无需依赖光栅化或路径追踪提示，通过点云和变压器模型直接预测光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局光照（GI）对于逼真渲染至关重要，但计算成本高且现有神经方法往往局限于2D空间或单场景优化，存在视角不一致和空间理解有限的问题。

Method: 使用点云表示场景的几何和材质特征，通过可扩展的变压器模型编码全局点对点交互为神经基元，渲染时通过最近邻搜索和交叉注意力聚合潜特征预测渲染量。

Result: 在多样室内场景中展示了漫反射全局光照预测效果，嵌入训练后可快速适应新渲染任务，并初步展示了空间方向辐射场估计的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为将学习到的先验整合到渲染管线中提供了一条路径，无需依赖显式的光线追踪提示。

Abstract: Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains
computationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light
transport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,
sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward
cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as
neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view
inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D
light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from
3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each
scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A
scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these
features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves
nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent
features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We
demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse
indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding
trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks
with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for
spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how
the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach
highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines
without explicit ray-traced illumination cues.

### [2] [ORDENA: ORigin-DEstiNAtion data exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18278)
*Karelia Salinas,Victor Barella,André Luiz Cunha,Gabriel Martins de Oliveira,Thales Viera,Luis Gustavo Nonato*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ORDENA是一款用于探索起讫点数据的可视化分析工具，通过散点图直观展示数据关系，并提供解释性资源帮助用户理解数据模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 起讫点流量分析在许多科学领域中是一个重要问题，但在处理大规模数据时，传统的数据聚合和交互过滤方法容易掩盖某些模式，且难以决定哪些数据应被过滤。

Method: ORDENA基于一个简单的散点图设计，横纵轴分别表示起点和目的地，每个起讫点流表示为散点图中的点，并通过点的布局揭示空间现象。此外，ORDENA提供解释性资源帮助用户理解数据。

Result: ORDENA通过案例研究展示了其有效性，并获得未参与开发的领域专家积极评价。

Conclusion: ORDENA作为一种可视化分析工具，能够有效帮助用户探索和理解起讫点数据的关系及模式。

Abstract: Analyzing origin-destination flows is an important problem that has been
extensively investigated in several scientific fields, particularly by the
visualization community. The problem becomes especially challenging when
involving massive data, demanding mechanisms such as data aggregation and
interactive filtering to make the exploratory process doable. However, data
aggregation tends to smooth out certain patterns, and deciding which data
should be filtered is not straightforward. In this work, we propose ORDENA, a
visual analytic tool to explore origin and destination data. ORDENA is built
upon a simple and intuitive scatter plot where the horizontal and vertical axes
correspond to origins and destinations. Therefore, each origin-destination flow
is represented as a point in the scatter plot. How the points are organized in
the plot layout reveals important spatial phenomena present in the data.
Moreover, ORDENA provides explainability resources that allow users to better
understand the relation between origin-destination flows and associated
attributes. We illustrate ORDENA's effectiveness in a set of case studies,
which have also been elaborated in collaboration with domain experts. The
proposed tool has also been evaluated by domain experts not involved in its
development, which provided quite positive feedback about ORDENA.

### [3] [MorphModes: Non-rigid Registration via Adaptive Skinning Eigenmodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18658)
*Gabrielle Browne,Mengfei Liu,Eitan Grinspun,Otman Benchekroun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于签名距离函数(SDF)匹配优化的非刚性配准方法，克服了传统NRICP算法的局限性，通过平滑皮肤特征模态子空间和自适应优化方案提高了鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非刚性迭代最近点(NRICP)算法易陷入局部极小值且对初始条件敏感，因此需要一种更鲁棒且能提供丰富形状信息的非刚性配准方法。

Method: 将非刚性配准问题建模为SDF匹配优化问题，利用平滑皮肤特征模态子空间参数化优化问题，并采用自适应子空间优化方案解决局部变形。

Result: 提出的方法在非刚性配准中表现优于NRICP算法，且避免了其他SDF匹配方法中的参数敏感性问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在非刚性配准任务中具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性，为解决复杂变形问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is a crucial task with applications in medical
imaging, industrial robotics, computer vision, and entertainment. Standard
approaches accomplish this task using variations on the Non-Rigid Iterative
Closest Point (NRICP) algorithms, which are prone to local minima and sensitive
to initial conditions. We instead formulate the non-rigid registration problem
as a Signed Distance Function (SDF) matching optimization problem, which
provides richer shape information compared to traditional ICP methods. To avoid
degenerate solutions, we propose to use a smooth Skinning Eigenmode subspace to
parameterize the optimization problem. Finally, we propose an adaptive subspace
optimization scheme to allow the resolution of localized deformations within
the optimization. The result is a non-rigid registration algorithm that is more
robust than NRICP, without the parameter sensitivity present in other
SDF-matching approaches.

### [4] [Hey Pentti, We Did It!: A Fully Vector-Symbolic Lisp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17889)
*Eilene Tomkins-Flanagan,Mary A. Kelly*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于向量符号架构（VSA）的Lisp语言实现，展示了其通用形式和具体实现，讨论了数学抽象的意义及其重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨向量符号架构（VSA）是否能完整实现Lisp语言，并验证其在数学抽象中的意义。

Method: 方法包括构造Lisp基本函数和辅助函数的向量符号表示，并使用全息缩减表示（HRR）和查找表清理内存的具体实现。

Result: 结果表明，基于VSA的Lisp实现是可行的，并通过数学讨论验证了其重要性。

Conclusion: 结论强调了向量符号架构的笛卡尔闭包性质及其在实现通用语言中的重要性，同时指出清理内存的必要性。

Abstract: Kanerva (2014) suggested that it would be possible to construct a complete
Lisp out of a vector-symbolic architecture. We present the general form of a
vector-symbolic representation of the five Lisp elementary functions, lambda
expressions, and other auxiliary functions, found in the Lisp 1.5 specification
McCarthy (1960), which is near minimal and sufficient for Turing-completeness.
Our specific implementation uses holographic reduced representations Plate
(1995), with a lookup table cleanup memory. Lisp, as all Turing-complete
languages, is a Cartesian closed category, unusual in its proximity to the
mathematical abstraction. We discuss the mathematics, the purpose, and the
significance of demonstrating vector-symbolic architectures' Cartesian-closure,
as well as the importance of explicitly including cleanup memories in the
specification of the architecture.

### [5] [ZipLex: Verified Invertible Lexing with Memoized Derivatives and Zippers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18479)
*Samuel Chassot,Viktor Kunčak*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: ZipLex是一个经过验证的可逆词法分析框架，不仅满足正则表达式语义和最大咀嚼属性，还保证词法分析和打印互为逆过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的已验证词法分析器仅关注正则表达式语义和最大咀嚼属性，ZipLex旨在提供一种保证词法分析和打印互为逆过程的解决方案。

Method: ZipLex的设计基于两组思想：(1) 新的词序列抽象方法，支持高效操作；(2) 结合已验证数据结构和优化技术（如Huet的拉链和记忆化派生）以实现实际性能。

Result: ZipLex在Scala中实现并通过Stainless验证器验证其正确性（包括可逆性）。评估表明，ZipLex支持JSON处理和编程语言词法分析等实际应用，性能介于Coqlex和Verbatim++之间。

Conclusion: ZipLex证明了已验证的可逆性可以在不显著增加成本的情况下实现，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We present ZipLex, a verified framework for invertible lexical analysis.
Unlike past verified lexers that focus only on satisfying the semantics of
regular expressions and the maximal munch property, ZipLex also guarantees that
lexing and printing are mutual inverses. Our design relies on two sets of
ideas: (1) a new abstraction of token sequences that captures the separability
of tokens in a sequence while supporting their efficient manipulation, and (2)
a combination of verified data structures and optimizations, including Huet's
zippers and memoized derivatives, to achieve practical performance. We
implemented ZipLex in Scala and verified its correctness, including
invertibility, using the Stainless verifier. Our evaluation demonstrates that
ZipLex supports realistic applications such as JSON processing and lexers of
programming languages. In comparison to other verified lexers (which do not
enforce invertibility), ZipLex is 4x slower than Coqlex and two orders of
magnitude faster than Verbatim++, showing that verified invertibility can be
achieved without prohibitive cost.

### [6] [CPSLint: A Domain-Specific Language Providing Data Validation and Sanitisation for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18651)
*Uraz Odyurt,Ömer Sayilir,Mariëlle Stoelinga,Vadim Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CPSLint，一种专为工业CPS设计的领域特定语言（DSL），用于解决大规模时间序列数据的预处理问题，以支持机器学习和故障检测工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业CPS领域的大规模时间序列数据通常需要进行预处理才能用于机器学习解决方案，但目前缺乏一种通用的解决方案。

Method: CPSLint通过类型检查、约束强制执行以及缺失数据填补等功能，提供了一种数据预处理方法。它还能推断CPS特有的数据结构。

Result: 通过概念验证实现，CPSLint展示了其在数据预处理方面的有效性，尤其是支持故障检测工作流。

Conclusion: CPSLint为工业CPS数据预处理提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案，填补了当前领域的空白。

Abstract: Raw datasets are often too large and unstructured to work with directly, and
require a data preparation process. The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts
of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such
data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric
workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide
data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data
collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable
for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification
(FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable
solution.
  CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints
through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing
data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra
CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as
row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of
data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI
workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept
implementation.

### [7] [On Condorcet's Jury Theorem with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18062)
*Reshef Meir,Ganesh Ghalme*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在选民面临不同参与成本且对自身影响力有启发式信念的非对称环境中，投票行为的多重稳定均衡。发现弱消失影响力信念导致选举几乎平局，而强消失影响力信念则导致唯一均衡，仅零成本选民参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在选民参与成本不对称且对自身影响力有启发式信念的情况下，投票行为的多重均衡现象及其对选举结果的影响。

Method: 在成本投票模型中，假设选民在参与成本高于其对影响力估计时选择弃权，分析了启发式信念的弱消失和强消失特性对均衡的影响。

Result: 弱消失影响力信念导致多重稳定均衡，选举几乎平局；强消失影响力信念导致唯一均衡，仅零成本选民参与。此外，低于某一阈值时，多数偏好的候选人胜选概率趋近于一；高于阈值时，双方胜选概率相等。

Conclusion: 启发式信念的性质显著影响投票均衡和选举结果，弱消失影响力信念可能导致选举不确定性增加，而强消失影响力信念则简化了均衡结构。

Abstract: The well-known Condorcet Jury Theorem states that, under majority rule, the
better of two alternatives is chosen with probability approaching one as the
population grows. We study an asymmetric setting where voters face varying
participation costs and share a possibly heuristic belief about their
pivotality (ability to influence the outcome).
  In a costly voting setup where voters abstain if their participation cost is
greater than their pivotality estimate, we identify a single property of the
heuristic belief -- weakly vanishing pivotality -- that gives rise to multiple
stable equilibria in which elections are nearly tied. In contrast, strongly
vanishing pivotality (as in the standard Calculus of Voting model) yields a
unique, trivial equilibrium where only zero-cost voters participate as the
population grows. We then characterize when nontrivial equilibria satisfy a
version of the Jury Theorem: below a sharp threshold, the majority-preferred
candidate wins with probability approaching one; above it, both candidates
either win with equal probability.

### [8] [Contextual Search in Principal-Agent Games: The Curse of Degeneracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18567)
*Yiding Feng,Mengfan Ma,Bo Peng,Zongqi Wan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了主代理游戏中的上下文搜索问题，提出了一个新的模型来扩展经典的上下文定价，并揭示了学习难度的双指数级分离现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是解决主代理游戏中的上下文搜索问题，特别是在主不知道代理真实成本或奖励的情况下，如何通过历史反馈优化合同设计。

Method: 采用了一种广义的主代理游戏模型，支持更丰富的代理动作空间，并通过上下信息和历史反馈来设计合同。

Result: 研究证明了在悲观Stackelberg后悔下，存在渐近紧的指数界T^(1 - Θ(1/d))，同时还展示了经典Stackelberg后悔的下界Ω(T^(1/2 - 1/(2d)))。

Conclusion: 研究表明，上下文动作退化现象导致学习难度显著增加，即使在动作较少的情况下也存在双指数级分离现象。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study contextual search in general
principal-agent games, where a principal repeatedly interacts with agents by
offering contracts based on contextual information and historical feedback,
without knowing the agents' true costs or rewards. Our model generalizes
classical contextual pricing by accommodating richer agent action spaces. Over
$T$ rounds with $d$-dimensional contexts, we establish an asymptotically tight
exponential $T^{1 - \Theta(1/d)}$ bound in terms of the pessimistic Stackelberg
regret, benchmarked against the best utility for the principal that is
consistent with the observed feedback.
  We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2d}})$ on
the classic Stackelberg regret for principal-agent games, demonstrating a
surprising double-exponential hardness separation from the contextual pricing
problem (a.k.a, the principal-agent game with two actions), which is known to
admit a near-optimal $O(d\log\log T)$ regret bound [Kleinberg and Leighton,
2003, Leme and Schneider, 2018, Liu et al., 2021]. In particular, this
double-exponential hardness separation occurs even in the special case with
three actions and two-dimensional context. We identify that this significant
increase in learning difficulty arises from a structural phenomenon that we
call contextual action degeneracy, where adversarially chosen contexts can make
some actions strictly dominated (and hence unincentivizable), blocking the
principal's ability to explore or learn about them, and fundamentally limiting
learning progress.

### [9] [Likelihood of the Existence of Average Justified Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18718)
*Qishen Han,Biaoshuai Tao,Lirong Xia,Chengkai Zhang,Houyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了基于批准的多赢家选举问题，重点关注平均合理代表（AJR）公理。通过Erdős–Rényi模型分析了AJR委员会存在的可能性，并发现了两个相变点p₁和p₂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多赢家选举中，平均合理代表（AJR）委员会的成立条件及其在不同参数下的存在概率，以弥补现有研究中AJR委员会不一定存在的理论空白。

Method: 采用Erdős–Rényi模型，通过概率p生成选举实例，分析AJR委员会在不同p值下的存在概率，并对m为常数、n趋近无穷大的情况进行了完整刻画。

Result: 发现两个相变点p₁和p₂：当p<p₁或p>p₂时，AJR委员会几乎必然存在；当p₁<p<p₂时，AJR委员会几乎不存在；当p=p₁或p=p₂时，存在概率介于0和1之间。

Conclusion: 完整刻画了AJR委员会在Erdős–Rényi模型下的存在概率，揭示了其在选举参数中的非线性行为，填补了现有研究的理论空白。

Abstract: We study the approval-based multi-winner election problem where $n$ voters
jointly decide a committee of $k$ winners from $m$ candidates. We focus on the
axiom \emph{average justified representation} (AJR) proposed by Fernandez,
Elkind, Lackner, Garcia, Arias-Fisteus, Basanta-Val, and Skowron (2017). AJR
postulates that every group of voters with a common preference should be
sufficiently represented in that their average satisfaction should be no less
than their Hare quota. Formally, for every group of
$\lceil\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}\rceil$ voters with $\ell$ common approved
candidates, the average number of approved winners for this group should be at
least $\ell$. It is well-known that a winning committee satisfying AJR is not
guaranteed to exist for all multi-winner election instances. In this paper, we
study the likelihood of the existence of AJR under the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
model. We consider the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model parameterized by $p\in[0,1]$
that samples multi-winner election instances from the distribution where each
voter approves each candidate with probability $p$ (and the events that voters
approve candidates are independent), and we provide a clean and complete
characterization of the existence of AJR committees in the case where $m$ is a
constant and $n$ tends to infinity. We show that there are two phase transition
points $p_1$ and $p_2$ (with $p_1\leq p_2$) for the parameter $p$ such that: 1)
when $p<p_1$ or $p>p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $1-o(1)$, 2)
when $p_1<p<p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $o(1)$, and 3) when
$p=p_1$ or $p=p_2$, the probability that an AJR committee exists is bounded
away from both $0$ and $1$.
