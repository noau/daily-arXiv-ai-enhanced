As such allocations may not exist for arbitrary instances, we ask if they exist for \\textit{typical} or \\textit{random} instances, meaning when the utility values of agents for the resources are drawn from certain distributions. If such allocations exist with high probability for typical instances, and furthermore if they can be computed efficiently, this would imply that we could quickly resolve a real world resource allocation scenario in a fair and efficient manner with high probability. This implication has made this setting popular and well studied in fair resource allocation.\n  In this paper, we extend the previously studied formal models of this problem to non-identical items. We assume that every item is associated with a distribution $\\mathcal{U}_j$, and every agent's utility value for the item is drawn independently from $\\mathcal{U}_j$. We show that envy-free fair and maximum social welfare efficient allocations exist with high probability in the asymptotic setting, meaning when the number of agents $n$ and items $m$ are large. Further we show that when $m=O(n\\log n),$ then by only sampling $O(\\log m)$ or $O((\\log m)^2)$ utility values per item instead of all the $n,$ we can compute these allocations in $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Finally, we simulate our algorithms on randomly generated instances and show that even for small instances, we suffer small multiplicative losses in the fairness and efficiency guarantees even for small sized instances, and converge to fully optimal guarantees quickly."}

Chappell", "Derek Abbott"], "title": "Analytical Stackelberg Resource Allocation in Sequential Attacker--Defender Games", "comment": "25 pages, one figure", "summary": "We develop an analytical Stackelberg game framework for optimal resource allocation in a sequential attacker--defender setting with a finite set of assets and probabilistic attacks. The defender commits to a mixed protection strategy, after which the attacker best-responds via backward induction. Closed-form expressions for equilibrium protection and attack strategies are derived for general numbers of assets and defensive resources. Necessary constraints on rewards and costs are established to ensure feasibility of the probability distributions. Three distinct payoff regimes for the defender are identified and analysed. An eight-asset numerical example illustrates the equilibrium structure and reveals a unique Pareto-dominant attack configuration."}

We study deterministic implementation in single-item auctions under two outcome notions: (revenue, welfare) pairs and interim allocations. For (revenue, welfare) pairs, we show a discrete separation: there exists a pair implementable by a deterministic Bayesian incentive-compatible (BIC) auction but not by any deterministic dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) auction. For continuous atomless priors, we identify conditions under which deterministic DSIC auctions are implementationally equivalent to randomized BIC auctions in terms of achievable outcomes. For interim allocations, we establish a deterministic analogue of Border's theorem for two bidders, providing a necessary and sufficient condition for deterministic DSIC implementability, and use it to exhibit an interim allocation implementable by a deterministic BIC auction but not by any deterministic DSIC auction."}

Among the various picking sequences, recursively balanced picking sequences -- whereby each agent picks one good in every round -- are notable for guaranteeing allocations that satisfy envy-freeness up to one good. In this paper, we compare the fairness of different recursively balanced picking sequences using two key measures. Firstly, we demonstrate that all such sequences have the same price in terms of egalitarian welfare relative to other picking sequences. Secondly, we characterize the approximate maximin share (MMS) guarantees of these sequences. In particular, we show that compensating the agent who picks last in the first round by letting her pick first in every subsequent round yields the best MMS guarantee."}
