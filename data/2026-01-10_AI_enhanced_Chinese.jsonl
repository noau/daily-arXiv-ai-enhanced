Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MoTS\u6846\u67b6\u548cSWAN\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoTS\u6846\u67b6\u548cSWAN\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u652f\u4ed8\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSWAN\u673a\u5236\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u9ad8\u8fbe352.42%\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8693.07%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6fc0\u52b1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement.\n  By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness.\n  To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space.\n  We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "StageSAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0cStageSAT\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "StageSAT\u5c06\u6d6e\u70b9\u516c\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5feb\u901f\u6295\u5f71\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u964d\u3001ULP$^2$\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684$n$-ULP\u683c\u5b50\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ed1\u76d2\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u822a\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "StageSAT\u5728SMT-COMP'25\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe99.4%\uff0c\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb5--10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0cStageSAT\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4f20\u7edfSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices.

Traditional approaches to handling left recursion in a recursive descent parser require grammar rewriting or complex algorithmic extensions. We derive a minimal algorithm from first principles: cycle detection via per-position state tracking and $O(1)$-per-LR-cycle communication from descendant to ancestor recursion frames, and fixed-point search via iterative expansion. For error recovery, we derived a set of four axioms and twelve constraints that must be imposed upon an optimal error recovery design to ensure completeness, correctness, optimality of performance, and intuitiveness of behavior. We utilized a constraint satisfaction mechanism to search the space of all possibilities, arriving at a provably optimal and robust error recovery strategy that maintains perfect performance linearity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u677e\u9f20\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u79cdPEG\u8bb0\u5fc6\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5de6\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9012\u5f52\u4e0b\u964d\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5de6\u9012\u5f52\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u6cd5\u91cd\u5199\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5468\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548cO(1)-per-LR-cycle\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u56db\u516c\u7406\u548c\u5341\u4e8c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u677e\u9f20\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In contrast, we focus on explicit, prompt-free editing, where the user directly specifies the modification by cropping and pasting an object or sub-object into a chosen location within an image. This operation affords precise spatial and visual control, yet it introduces a fundamental challenge: preserving the identity of the pasted object while harmonizing it with its new context. We observe that attention maps in diffusion-based editing models inherently govern whether image regions are preserved or adapted for coherence. Building on this insight, we introduce LooseRoPE, a saliency-guided modulation of rotational positional encoding (RoPE) that loosens the positional constraints to continuously control the attention field of view. By relaxing RoPE in this manner, our method smoothly steers the model's focus between faithful preservation of the input image and coherent harmonization of the inserted object, enabling a balanced trade-off between identity retention and contextual blending. Our approach provides a flexible and intuitive framework for image editing, achieving seamless compositional results without textual descriptions or complex user input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLooseRoPE\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08RoPE\uff09\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u89c2\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f83\u7c97\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u7c98\u8d34\u5bf9\u8c61\u6765\u6307\u5b9a\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u65b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LooseRoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236RoPE\u6765\u653e\u677e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u91ce\u3002", "result": "LooseRoPE\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8c03\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}
