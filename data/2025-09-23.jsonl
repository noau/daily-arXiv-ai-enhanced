In any such exchange, agents must carefully balance the\nbenefit of acquiring valuable data against the cost of sharing their own.\nEnsuring stability in these exchanges is essential to prevent agents -- or\ngroups of agents -- from departing and conducting local (and potentially more\nfavorable) exchanges among themselves. To address this, we study a model where\nagents participate in a data exchange. Each agent has an associated payoff for\nthe data acquired from other agents and a cost incurred during sharing its own\ndata. The net utility of an agent is payoff minus the cost. We adapt the\nclassical notion of core-stability from cooperative game theory to data\nexchange. A data exchange is core-stable if no subset of agents has any\nincentive to deviate to a different exchange. We show that a core-stable data\nexchange is guaranteed to exist when agents have concave payoff functions and\nconvex cost functions -- a setting typical in domains like PAC learning and\nrandom discovery models. We show that relaxing either of the foregoing\nconditions may result in the nonexistence of core-stable data exchanges. Then,\nwe prove that finding a core-stable exchange is PPAD-hard, even when the\npotential blocking coalitions are restricted to constant size. To the best of\nour knowledge, this provides the first known PPAD-hardness result for core-like\nguarantees in data economics. Finally, we show that data exchange can be\nmodelled as a balanced $n$-person game. This immediately gives a pivoting\nalgorithm via Scarf's theorem \\cite{Scarf1967core}. We show that the pivoting\nalgorithm works well in practice through our empirical results."}

Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and\nTorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic\ncontrol flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into\nmultiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode,\nincur costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization\nopportunities. GraphMend addresses this limitation by analyzing and\ntransforming source code before execution. Built on the Jac compilation\nframework, GraphMend introduces two code transformations that remove graph\nbreaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions. This design allows\nPyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs\nwithout requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight\nHugging Face models shows that GraphMend removes all fixable graph breaks due\nto dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions, driving the break count to 0\nin 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090\nand A40 GPUs, GraphMend achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8%\nhigher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code\ntransformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation\npipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance."}
