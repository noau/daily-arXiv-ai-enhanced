We aim at questioning five decades\nof traditional paradigms in geometric CAD and focus at new generation of CAD\nobjects that are not solid, but contain heterogeneous free-form internal\nmicrostructures. We propose a unified manufacturing pipeline that involves all\nstages, namely design, optimization, manufacturing, and inspection of\nmicrostructured free-form geometries.

We propose a novel\nyet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,\ni.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the\ndomain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing\nthe part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several\nclippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each\ndomain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed\nmethod to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental\nresults show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art\nones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to\nSIGGRAPH Asia 2025."}

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches."}

There is an unknown state of the world that\ninfluences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal\ninformation about the state to all agents. The agents update their\npreconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose\nalgorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various\naspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we\nshow that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class\nof range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We\nprovide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of\npreconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a\npolynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S.

However, robustly modeling general\ndynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while\nmaintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,\nwe present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that\ndisentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and\ntopological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion\nGaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and\nphotometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture\nfine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a\nset of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current\nframe to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.\nThis activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and\nmaintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under\nchallenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration\ninto codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup\nTable that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into\na lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video\ncodecs and supports up to 40 compression. TaoGS provides a unified, adaptive\nsolution for scalable volumetric video under topological variation, capturing\nmoments where \"elegance in motion\" and \"Power in Stillness\", delivering\nimmersive experiences that harmonize with the physical world."}

However, their expressiveness has been insufficient for\ntracking capabilities embedded in generic data structures, preventing them from\nscaling to the standard collections library -- an essential prerequisite for\nbroader adoption. This limitation stems from the inability to name capabilities\nwithin the system's notion of box types.\n  This paper develops System Capless, a new foundation for capturing types that\nprovides the theoretical basis for reach capabilities (rcaps), a novel\nmechanism for naming \"what's in the box.\" The calculus refines the universal\ncapability notion into a new scheme with existential and universal capture set\nquantification. Intuitively, rcaps witness existentially quantified capture\nsets inside the boxes of generic types in a way that does not require exposing\nexistential capture types in the surface language. We have fully mechanized the\nformal metatheory of System Capless in Lean, including proofs of type soundness\nand scope safety. System Capless supports the same lightweight notation of\ncapturing types plus rcaps, as certified by a type-preserving translation, and\nalso enables fully optional explicit capture-set quantification to increase\nexpressiveness.\n  Finally, we present a full reimplementation of capture checking in Scala 3\nbased on System Capless and migrate the entire Scala collections library and an\nasynchronous programming library to evaluate its practicality and ergonomics.\nOur results demonstrate that reach capabilities enable the adoption of capture\nchecking in production code with minimal changes and minimal-to-zero notational\noverhead in a vast majority of cases."}
