Moving beyond the traditional focus on utilitarian and egalitarian objectives, we design learning-augmented facility location mechanisms on a line for the envy ratio objective, a fairness metric defined as the maximum ratio between the utilities of any two agents. For the deterministic setting, we propose a mechanism which utilizes predictions to achieve $α$-consistency and $\\fracα{α- 1}$-robustness for a selected parameter $α\\in [1,2]$, and prove its optimality. We also resolve open questions raised by Ding et al. [10], devising a randomized mechanism without predictions to improve upon the best-known approximation ratio from $2$ to $1.8944$. Building upon these advancements, we construct a novel randomized mechanism which incorporates predictions to achieve improved performance guarantees."}

Matthew Weinberg", "Chenghan Zhou"], "title": "Analyzing the Economic Impact of Decentralization on Users", "comment": "In Proc. of the 17th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS 2026)", "summary": "We model the ultimate price paid by users of a decentralized ledger as resulting from a two-stage game where Miners (/Proposers/etc.) first purchase blockspace via a Tullock contest, and then price that space to users. When analyzing our distributed ledger model, we find:\n  - A characterization of all possible pure equilibria (although pure equilibria are not guaranteed to exist).\n  - A natural sufficient condition, implied by Regularity (a la [Mye81]), for existence of a ``market-clearing'' pure equilibrium where Miners choose to sell all space allocated by the Distributed Ledger Protocol, and that this equilibrium is unique.\n  - The market share of the largest miner is the relevant ``measure of decentralization'' to determine whether a market-clearing pure equilibrium exists.\n  - Block rewards do not impact users' prices at equilibrium, when pure equilibria exist. But, higher block rewards can cause pure equilibria to exist.\n  We also discuss aspects of our model and how they relate to blockchains deployed in practice. For example, only ``patient'' users (who are happy for their transactions to enter the blockchain under any miner) would enjoy the conclusions highlighted by our model, whereas ``impatient'' users (who are interested only for their transaction to be included in the very next block) still face monopoly pricing."}

Published in Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (POPL 2026)", "summary": "Relative monads provide a controlled view of computation. We generalise the monadic metalanguage to a relative setting and give a complete semantics with strong relative monads. Adopting this perspective, we generalise two existing program calculi from the literature. We provide a linear-non-linear language for graded monads, LNL-RMM, along with a semantic proof that it is a conservative extension of the graded monadic metalanguage. Additionally, we provide a complete semantics for the arrow calculus, showing it is a restricted relative monadic metalanguage. This motivates the introduction of ARMM, a computational lambda calculus-style language for arrows that conservatively extends the arrow calculus."}
