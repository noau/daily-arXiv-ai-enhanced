Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

*Kaiwen Jiang,Jia-Mu Sun,Zilu Li,Dan Wang,Tzu-Mao Li,Ravi Ramamoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯曲面元的高效可微分光传输框架，解决了辐射场在材料反射特性和光照条件建模上的不足，支持漫反射和镜面材料，并通过新型求解器和反向传递优化提升了全局光照的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐射场在视图合成和几何重建方面取得了巨大成功，但在材料反射特性和光照条件建模上存在不足，导致几何模糊性和无法轻松实现重光照。本文旨在通过引入物理渲染来解决这些限制。

Method: 采用高斯曲面元作为基本单元，构建了一个基于经典辐射度理论的高效可微分光传输框架。该框架在球谐系数空间中操作，支持漫反射和镜面材料，并提出了非二元可见性和半透明基元的新型求解器。

Result: 框架在推理时实现了视图独立渲染，光照传输无需因视角变化而重新计算，支持数百FPS的全局光照效果，包括使用球谐表示的视点相关反射。实验表明其在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过高效的光传输求解器和反向传递优化，显著提升了辐射场在几何重建和光照条件建模上的性能，适用于稀疏数据集下的多种光照条件。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

### [3] [Text Slider: Efficient and Plug-and-Play Continuous Concept Control for Image/Video Synthesis via LoRA Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18831)
*Pin-Yen Chiu,I-Sheng Fang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一种轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，并且需要为不同的扩散主干重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。Text Slider旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: Text Slider通过识别预训练文本编码器中的低秩方向，实现连续控制视觉概念，同时支持多概念组合和连续控制。

Result: Text Slider在训练速度上比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider是一种高效的解决方案，能够实现对视觉概念的细粒度和灵活控制，同时保持输入的空间布局和结构。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

### [4] [One-shot Embroidery Customization via Contrastive LoRA Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18948)

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的新框架，通过单张参考图像实现细粒度风格和内容特征的解耦，适用于刺绣等精细纹理的风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刺绣等纺织品艺术形式因其复杂的针法和材质特性，对现有风格迁移方法提出挑战，需要更精细的特征处理。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，通过两阶段对比性LoRA调制技术解耦风格和内容特征，并设计了推理管道处理图像或文本输入。

Result: 新方法在刺绣定制任务中表现优异，并在艺术风格迁移、线稿上色和外观迁移三个领域展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地实现了细粒度风格迁移任务，尤其在刺绣定制领域超越现有方法，同时具备广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.

### [5] [A Verified Compiler for Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18583)
*Liyi Li,Fenfen An,Federico Zahariev,Zhi Xiang Chong,Amr Sabry,Mark Gordon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: QBlue 是一个基于二次量子化形式的高层次、形式化验证框架，用于编译哈密顿模拟，支持数字和模拟量子电路，并在 Rocq 证明框架中全面验证了其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的哈密顿模拟编译器通常基于低层次的泡利算子表示，限制了可编程性，并且在编译过程中缺乏形式化正确性保证。因此，需要一种高层次且形式化验证的框架以提高编程能力和可靠性。

Method: QBlue 基于二次量子化形式，使用产生和湮灭算子描述量子粒子系统，并通过类型系统跟踪粒子类型并强制保持厄米结构。框架将静态约束和动态演化等多个语义层纳入编译过程。

Result: QBlue 支持从高层次描述到数字和模拟量子电路的编译，并通过 Rocq 证明框架对其语言设计、类型系统和编译正确性进行了全面形式化验证。

Conclusion: QBlue 是首个针对二次量子化哈密顿模拟的端到端验证编译器，显著提高了编程表达的灵活性和编译器的可靠性。

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with
significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex
optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus
on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability
and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation
pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for
compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second
quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum
particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety
and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and
enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both
digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics,
from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue,
including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are
fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end
verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.

### [6] [On Sybil-proofness in Restaking Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18338)
*Tarun Chitra,Paolo Penna,Manvir Schneider*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个形式化框架来分析重质押网络中防止Sybil攻击的机制，区分了两类攻击，并证明了没有任何惩罚机制能同时阻止两种攻击。同时，研究了网络结构对攻击盈利能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重质押协议扩展了验证者的责任，但安全性依赖于对Sybil攻击的抵抗能力。论文旨在形式化分析重质押网络中Sybil攻击的防御机制及其局限性。

Method: 论文引入了一个形式化框架，区分了两类Sybil攻击，并分析了两类惩罚机制（边际和倍增）的防御能力。同时，通过随机图模型（如Erdős-Rényi网络和两区块随机块模型）研究网络结构的影响。

Result: 论文证明了一个不可能性定理：没有惩罚机制能同时阻止两类Sybil攻击。此外，研究表明即使在网络中引入最小的异质性，也会导致Sybil攻击有利可图。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了重质押机制设计的基本限制，并强调了网络拓扑结构在安全性中的关键作用。

Abstract: Restaking protocols expand validator responsibilities beyond consensus, but
their security depends on resistance to Sybil attacks. We introduce a formal
framework for Sybil-proofness in restaking networks, distinguishing between two
types of attacks, one in which other Sybil identities are kept out of an attack
and one where multiple Sybil identities attack. We analyze marginal and
multiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which
each deters Sybil strategies. We then prove an impossibility theorem: no
slashing mechanism can simultaneously prevent both attack types. Finally, we
study the impact of network structure through random graph models: while
Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks remain Sybil-proof, even minimal heterogeneity in a
two-block stochastic block model makes Sybil attacks profitable. These results
reveal fundamental limits of mechanism design for restaking and highlight the
critical role of network topology.

### [7] [Fair Decisions through Plurality: Results from a Crowdfunding Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18343)
*Joel Miller,E. Glen Weyl,Chris Kanich*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为CO-QF的新算法，旨在解决Quadratic Funding（QF）在众筹平台上的公平性和经济效率问题，通过理论和实证验证其表现优于QF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法QF的设计基于个体孤立且自私的模型，导致公平性和效率问题，需要提出更优的替代方案。

Method: 通过技术和定性方法分析QF的问题，并设计了一种新的算法CO-QF，基于多元化和亲社会效用的理论。

Result: CO-QF在平台上实现了89%的采用率，并已分配超过400万美元，模拟显示其社会福利表现优于QF。

Conclusion: CO-QF不仅适用于特定社区的需求，还可推广为通用的公共决策工具。

Abstract: We discuss an algorithmic intervention aimed at increasing equity and
economic efficiency at a crowdfunding platform that gives cash subsidies to
grantees. Through a blend of technical and qualitative methods, we show that
the previous algorithm used by the platform -- Quadratic Funding (QF) --
suffered problems because its design was rooted in a model of individuals as
isolated and selfish. We present an alternative algorithm --
Connection-Oriented Quadratic Funding (CO-QF) -- rooted in a theory of
plurality and prosocial utilities, and show that it qualitatively and
quantitatively performs better than QF. CO-QF has achieved an 89% adoption rate
at the platform and has distributed over $4 Million to date. In simulations we
show that it provides better social welfare than QF. While our design for CO-QF
was responsive to the needs of a specific community, we also extrapolate out of
this context to show that CO-QF is a potentially helpful tool for
general-purpose public decision making.

### [8] [Group Formation through Game Theory and Agent-Based Modeling: Spatial Cohesion, Heterogeneity, and Resource Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18551)
*Chenlan Wang,Jimin Han,Diana Jue-Rajasingh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文通过博弈论模型和多智能体模型研究资源池化、空间凝聚和异质性驱动的群体形成，重点关注跨部门合作中不同组织的资源贡献和稳定群体均衡的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨部门合作中群体形成的动态，特别是不同组织在资源贡献和空间条件下的策略选择，以揭示群体规模和多样性的关键因素。

Method: 使用博弈论模型和多智能体模型，模拟在竞争环境中代理如何根据资源池化、空间凝聚和异质性进行策略性群体形成。

Result: 有限的个体资源导致群体主要由附近的参与者形成，而丰富的资源允许群体跨越更大距离；资源异质性和空间接近促进更大、更多样化的群体形成。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了群体规模和多样性的关键权衡，为跨部门合作和多智能体系统的有效策略提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic model and an agent-based model to study
group formation driven by resource pooling, spatial cohesion, and
heterogeneity. We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public,
private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources.
Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in
response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of
stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial
and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources
lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources
allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity
and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups.
These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition,
guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent
systems.

### [9] [Proximately Envy-Free and Efficient Allocation of Mixed Manna](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18673)
*Siddharth Barman,Paritosh Verma*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文证明了对于混合物品（既有商品又有杂务），存在一种分配方式，既满足帕累托效率（PO）又满足内省性无嫉妒性（IEF1），从而扩展了Mahara关于纯杂务分配的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平和高效地分配不可分割物品是公平分割领域的核心问题。尽管此前已经证明了纯商品和纯杂务的分配存在PO和EF1解，但对于混合物品的存在性仍然是未解决的问题。

Method: 论文通过引入内省性无嫉妒性（IEF1）的概念，证明了混合物品分配中存在满足PO和IEF1的解。这种分配方式允许每个代理通过调整自己的物品束来消除嫉妒。

Result: 研究结果表明，对于混合物品，确实存在满足PO和IEF1的分配方式。这一结果不仅解决了混合物品分配的存在性问题，还扩展了Mahara的研究成果。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入IEF1的概念，成功证明了混合物品分配中存在满足PO和IEF1的解，填补了公平分配领域的一个重要空白。

Abstract: The existence of fair and efficient allocations of indivisible items is a
central problem in fair division. For indivisible goods, the existence of
Pareto efficient (PO) and envy free up to one item (EF1) allocations was
established by Caragiannis et al. In a recent breakthrough, Mahara established
the existence of PO and EF1 allocations for indivisible chores.
  However, the existence of PO and EF1 allocations of mixed manna remains an
intriguing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress in this
direction. We establish the existence of allocations that are PO and
introspective envy free up to one item (IEF1) for mixed manna. In an IEF1
allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by
either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of
IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our existence result
generalizes the aforementioned result of Mahara.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管选举控制问题中的决策复杂性研究很多，但近似算法却很少被关注。本文旨在填补这一空白，尤其在多数、批准和Condorcet投票规则下研究近似算法的应用。

Method: 利用Covering Integer Programs (CIPs)的近似性，并基于Minimum $k$-Union (M$k$U)问题的下限，提出了一种$O(m)$-近似算法，同时将其推广到无限族投票规则中。

Result: 在多数投票规则下获得了$O(m)$-近似算法，并证明其下限为$Ω(m^{1/4})$；在批准和Condorcet投票规则下，证明任何近似算法都是最优的，除非P=NP。

Conclusion: 本文填补了选举控制问题中近似算法的研究空白，解决了18年前的开放问题，并提供了首个在计算社会选择中应用M$k$U问题的案例。

Abstract: Much research in electoral control -- one of the most studied form of
electoral attacks, in which an entity running an election alters the structure
of that election to yield a preferred outcome -- has focused on giving decision
complexity results, e.g., membership in P, NP-completeness, or fixed-parameter
tractability. Approximation algorithms on the other hand have received little
attention in electoral control, despite their prevalence in the study of other
forms of electoral attacks, such as manipulation and bribery. Early work
established some preliminary results with respect to popular voting rules such
as plurality, approval, and Condorcet. In this paper, we establish for each of
the ``standard'' control problems under plurality, approval, and Condorcet,
whether they are approximable, and we prove our results in both the weighted
and unweighted voter settings. For each problem we study under either approval
or Condorcet, we show that any approximation algorithm we give is optimal,
unless P=NP. Our approximation algorithms leverage the fact that Covering
Integer Programs (CIPs) can be approximated within a factor of $O(\log n)$.
Under plurality, we give an $O(m)$-approximation algorithm, and give as lower
bound $\Omega(m^{1/4})$, by using a known lower bound on the Minimum $k$-Union
(M$k$U) problem. To our knowledge, this is the first application of M$k$U in
computational social choice. We also generalize our $O(m)$-approximation
algorithm to work with respect to an infinite family of voting rules using an
axiomatic approach. Our work closes a long list of open problems established 18
years ago.
