Abstract: Holographic displays offer significant potential for augmented and virtual reality applications by reconstructing wavefronts that enable continuous depth cues and natural parallax without vergence-accommodation conflict. However, despite advances in pixel-level image quality, current systems struggle to achieve perceptually accurate color reproduction--an essential component of visual realism. These challenges arise from complex system-level distortions caused by coherent laser illumination, spatial light modulator imperfections, chromatic aberrations, and camera-induced color biases. In this work, we propose a perceptually-aware color management framework for holographic displays that jointly addresses input-output color inconsistencies through color space transformation, adaptive illumination control, and neural network-based perceptual modeling of the camera's color response. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical simulations, optical experiments, and a controlled user study. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in perceptual color fidelity, laying the groundwork for perceptually driven holographic rendering in future systems.

Main category: cs.GR

Method: 提出了条件自适应高斯头像（CAG-Avatar）框架，核心是一个基于交叉注意力的条件自适应融合模块，使每个高斯查询能够根据其规范位置自适应提取驱动信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了重建保真度，特别是在牙齿等挑战性区域，同时保持了实时渲染性能。

Conclusion: CAG-Avatar框架通过条件自适应驱动信号的提取，成功解决了现有技术的局限性，为高保真、实时驱动的3D头像动画提供了新方向。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, real-time drivable 3D head avatars is a core challenge in digital animation. While 3D Gaussian Splashing (3D-GS) offers unprecedented rendering speed and quality, current animation techniques often rely on a "one-size-fits-all" global tuning approach, where all Gaussian primitives are uniformly driven by a single expression code. This simplistic approach fails to unravel the distinct dynamics of different facial regions, such as deformable skin versus rigid teeth, leading to significant blurring and distortion artifacts. We introduce Conditionally-Adaptive Gaussian Avatars (CAG-Avatar), a framework that resolves this key limitation. At its core is a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module built on cross-attention. This mechanism empowers each 3D Gaussian to act as a query, adaptively extracting relevant driving signals from the global expression code based on its canonical position. This "tailor-made" conditioning strategy drastically enhances the modeling of fine-grained, localized dynamics. Our experiments confirm a significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity, particularly for challenging regions such as teeth, while preserving real-time rendering performance.

### [3] [DeGAS: Gradient-Based Optimization of Probabilistic Programs without Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15167)
*Francesca Randone,Romina Doz,Mirco Tribastone,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: DeGAS是一种可微分的高斯近似语义方法，适用于无循环概率程序，支持对包含连续和离散组件的模型进行无采样、基于梯度的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率程序中包含连续和离散变量时，基于采样的方法（如MCMC）可能在优化问题时难以收敛，因此需要一种无采样、基于梯度的解决方案。

Method: DeGAS采用高斯混合语义评估程序，并使用平滑技术替代零测度谓词和离散分支，从而得到后验和路径概率的闭式表达式。

Result: 在13个基准程序上，DeGAS的准确性和运行时表现与变分推断和MCMC相当，并在基于采样的方法失败的优化问题上表现稳定。

Conclusion: DeGAS通过可微分的高斯近似语义，实现了对无循环概率程序的优化，解决了基于采样方法在涉及连续变量时的收敛问题。

Abstract: We present DeGAS, a differentiable Gaussian approximate semantics for loopless probabilistic programs that enables sample-free, gradient-based optimization in models with both continuous and discrete components. DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators. On thirteen benchmark programs, DeGAS achieves accuracy and runtime competitive with variational inference and MCMC. Importantly, it reliably tackles optimization problems where sampling-based baselines fail to converge due to conditioning involving continuous variables.

### [4] [Contextual Metaprogramming for Session Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15180)
*Pedro Ângelo,Atsushi Igarashi,Yuito Murase,Vasco T. Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 将分阶段元编程整合到会话类型的消息传递函数式语言中，提出了一种基于多级上下文的上下文模态类型理论模型，支持将上下文值装箱并在消息中传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决服务器按需准备和发送代码等实际应用场景的需求，提出了一个支持线性与无限制资源区分的类型系统。

Method: 构建了一个基于多级上下文的上下文模态类型理论模型，设计了类型检查器，并区分了线性和无限制资源。

Result: 展示了类型保留性、顺序计算的进展性以及并发运行时环境的无运行时错误，同时证明了类型检查器的正确性。

Conclusion: 该系统在实际应用中表现出色，适合处理复杂的代码传输和运行场景。

Abstract: We propose the integration of staged metaprogramming into a session-typed message passing functional language. We build on a model of contextual modal type theory with multi-level contexts, where contextual values, closing arbitrary terms over a series of variables, may be boxed and transmitted in messages. Once received, one such value may then be unboxed and locally applied before being run. To motivate this integration, we present examples of real-world use cases, for which our system would be suitable, such as servers preparing and shipping code on demand via session typed messages. We present a type system that distinguishes linear (used exactly once) from unrestricted (used an unbounded number of times) resources, and further define a type checker, suitable for a concrete implementation. We show type preservation, a progress result for sequential computations and absence of runtime errors for the concurrent runtime environment, as well as the correctness of the type checker.

### [5] [Shapley Value on Uncertain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14543)
*Zhuofan Jia,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对概率数据分布的Shapley值框架，用于量化每个参与者的期望贡献和方差，从而捕获随机采样引入的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要假设参与者提供固定且确定的数据集，而实践中数据所有者通常提供从概率分布中抽取的样本，导致边际贡献具有随机性，Shapley值本身也成为随机变量。

Method: 论文提出了一种理论框架，推导了概率Shapley值的期望和方差的无偏估计量，并分析了其统计性质；同时提出了三种蒙特卡罗估计算法（基线估计器、池化估计器和分层池化估计器）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，这些方法在准确性和效率之间取得了良好的平衡，其中分层池化方法以最小的额外成本实现了显著方差减少。

Conclusion: 通过将Shapley值分析从确定性数据集扩展到概率数据分布，该研究为现代随机数据共享环境中的公平可靠数据估值提供了理论严谨性和实用工具。

Abstract: The Shapley value provides a principled framework for fairly distributing rewards among participants according to their individual contributions. While prior work has applied this concept to data valuation in machine learning, existing formulations overwhelmingly assume that each participant contributes a fixed, deterministic dataset. In practice, however, data owners often provide samples drawn from underlying probabilistic distributions, introducing stochasticity into their marginal contributions and rendering the Shapley value itself a random variable. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework for the Shapley value of probabilistic data distributions that quantifies both the expected contribution and the variance of each participant, thereby capturing uncertainty induced by random sampling. We develop theoretical and empirical methodologies for estimating these quantities: on the theoretical side, we derive unbiased estimators for the expectation and variance of the probabilistic Shapley value and analyze their statistical properties; on the empirical side, we introduce three Monte Carlo-based estimation algorithms - a baseline estimator using independent samples, a pooled estimator that improves efficiency through sample reuse, and a stratified pooled estimator that adaptively allocates sampling budget based on player-specific variability. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that these methods achieve strong accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, with the stratified pooled approach attaining substantial variance reduction at minimal additional cost. By extending Shapley value analysis from deterministic datasets to probabilistic data distributions, this work provides both theoretical rigor and practical tools for fair and reliable data valuation in modern stochastic data-sharing environments.

### [6] [Interval Scheduling Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15148)
*Vipin Ravindran Vijayalakshmi,Marc Schroder,Tami Tamir*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了区间调度问题的博弈论变体，涉及作业的长度、权重和颜色，玩家通过策略最大化自身颜色的覆盖作业权重总和，机器则最大化所有覆盖作业的总权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源自无线网络天线调度等实际应用问题，探讨多玩家博弈环境下的区间调度问题。

Method: 首先证明玩家策略下机器调度问题可在多项式时间内解决，然后从玩家视角分析纳什均衡的存在性、计算和效率问题。

Result: 结果表明机器调度问题在给定策略下可高效解决，同时区分了单作业和多作业玩家的不同博弈场景。

Conclusion: 论文通过博弈论方法分析了区间调度问题的复杂性，为实际应用中的多玩家调度提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We consider a game-theoretic variant of an interval scheduling problem. Every job is associated with a length, a weight, and a color. Each player controls all the jobs of a specific color, and needs to decide on a processing interval for each of its jobs. Jobs of the same color can be processed simultaneously by the machine. A job is covered if the machine is configured to its color during its whole processing interval. The goal of the machine is to maximize the sum of weights of all covered jobs, and the goal of each player is to place its jobs such that the sum of weights of covered jobs from its color is maximized. The study of this game is motivated by several applications like antenna scheduling for wireless networks.
  We first show that given a strategy profile of the players, the machine scheduling problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then study the game from the players' point of view. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibria, its computation, and inefficiency. We distinguish between instances of the classical interval scheduling problem, in which every player controls a single job, and instances in which color sets may include multiple jobs.

### [7] [Real-time Facial Communication Restores Cooperation After Defection in Social Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15211)
*Mayada Oudah,John Wooders*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究发现，实时面部表情沟通在重复囚徒困境中显著提高整体合作率，并促进背叛后的合作恢复，显示面部表情有助于减少对背叛的负面解读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情在人类互动中至关重要，但其在战略决策中的作用鲜有研究。本研究旨在探讨实时面部表情沟通如何影响重复社会困境中的合作行为。

Method: 通过实验室实验，参与者分别在有面部表情沟通（通过性别中立虚拟形象）和无面部表情沟通的条件下玩重复囚徒困境游戏。研究使用先进的生物识别技术实时捕捉和显示情绪。

Result: 研究发现，面部表情沟通显著提高了整体合作率，并特别促进了背叛后的合作恢复，表明面部表情有助于减轻对背叛的负面解读，促进宽恕和合作继续。

Conclusion: 面部表情对战略结果具有显著影响，尤其是在虚拟环境中促进合作。这些结果为设计情感响应式虚拟代理和数字平台提供了实践启示，以在物理缺席的情况下维持合作。

Abstract: Facial expressions are central to human interaction, yet their role in strategic decision-making has received limited attention. We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在代理人分布且分组的场景下，公平且高效地选择设施位置，同时防止代理人通过策略性报告位置获益。

Method: 采用两阶段机制：第一阶段每组选择一个代理人位置作为代表；第二阶段从所有代表中选择k个位置作为设施点。

Result: 针对两种个体成本定义（总和变体和最大值变体），建立了策略证明机制在社会成本上的紧界近似比。

Conclusion: 本研究为分布式设施位置问题提供了策略证明机制的紧界近似比，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study a distributed facility location problem in which a set of agents, each with a private position on the real line, is partitioned into a collection of fixed, disjoint groups. The goal is to open $k$ facilities at locations chosen from the set of positions reported by the agents. This decision is made by mechanisms that operate in two phases. In Phase 1, each group selects the position of one of its agents to serve as the group's representative location. In Phase 2, $k$ representatives are chosen as facility locations. Once the facility locations are determined, each agent incurs an individual cost, defined either as the sum of its distances to all facilities (sum-variant) or as the distance to its farthest facility (max-variant). We focus on the class of strategyproof mechanisms, which preclude the agents from benefiting through strategic misreporting, and establish tight bounds on the approximation ratio with respect to the social cost (the total individual agent cost) in both variants.
