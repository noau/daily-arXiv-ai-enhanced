Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform\nfeature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major\nchallenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny\ndetails at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same\nweights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and\ntext. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive\nleveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts\naway from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for\nmulti-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in\nisolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models\nand adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes\nretrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent\nof the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments\non the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our\nmethod achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an\naverage Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up\nto 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides\nan effective and general solution for CIR."}

This data, gathered\nfrom sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of\ndetailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a\ncomparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point\nclouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit\ntechniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models\noffer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight\nanalysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing\nhigh-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability.\nBased on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most\npromising path forward.

Lin", "Siddhartha Banerjee", "Éva Tardos"], "title": "Dynamic Allocation of Public Goods with Approximate Core Equilibria", "comment": "44 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "We consider the problem of repeatedly allocating multiple shareable public\ngoods that have limited availability in an online setting without the use of\nmoney. In our setting, agents have additive values, and the value each agent\nreceives from getting access to the goods in each period is drawn i.i.d. from\nsome joint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ (that can be arbitrarily correlated\nbetween agents). The principal also has global constraints on the set of goods\nthey can select over the horizon, which is represented via a submodular\nallocation-cost function. Our goal is to select the periods to allocate the\ngood to ensure high value for each group of agents.\n  We develop mechanisms for this problem using an artificial currency, where we\ngive each agent a budget proportional to their (exogenous) fair share. The\ncorrelated value distribution makes this an especially challenging problem, as\nagents may attempt to free-ride by declaring low valuations for the good when\nthey know other agents have high values-hoping those agents will bear a larger\nshare of the cost of the resource. We offer a black-box reduction from monetary\nmechanisms for the allocation of a costly excludable public good. We focus on\npacing strategies, the natural strategies when using AI agents, where agents\nreport a scaled version of their value to the mechanism. Our main results show\nthat when using a truthful monetary mechanism as our building block, the\nresulting online mechanism has a focal equilibrium in which each agent plays a\npacing strategy whose outcome results in an allocation that is a\n$(\\mathcal{H}_n-1)$-approximation of the core, where $\\mathcal{H}_n$ is the\nHarmonic number, and $n$ is the number of agents. Remarkably, we are able to\nachieve an approximate core solution as a Nash outcome without explicit\ncollaboration or coordination between the agents."}

The stability of a matching depends on\nthese preferences, which in uncertain environments also reflect agents' beliefs\nabout the underlying state of the world. We investigate how a principal -- who\nobserves the true state of the world -- can strategically shape these beliefs\nthrough Bayesian persuasion to induce stable matching that maximizes a desired\nutility. Due to the general intractability of the underlying matching\noptimization problem as well as the multi-receiver persuasion problem, our main\nconsiderations are two important special cases: (1) when agents can be\ncategorized into a small number of types based on their value functions, and\n(2) when the number of possible world states is small. For each case, we study\nboth public and private signaling settings. Our results draw a complete\ncomplexity landscape: we show that private persuasion remains intractable even\nwhen the number of worlds is small, while all other settings admit\npolynomial-time algorithms. We present efficient algorithms for each tractable\ncase and prove NP-hardness for the intractable ones. These results illuminate\nthe algorithmic frontier of stable matching under information design and\nclarify when optimal persuasion is computationally feasible."}

The agent observes only a noisy ranking of the candidates plus a binary\nsignal that indicates whether each candidate is \"free\" or \"busy.\" Being busy is\npositively correlated with higher quality, but can also reduce value due to\ndecreased availability. We study the agent's optimal selection problem in the\npresence of ranking noise and free-busy signals and ask how the accuracy of the\nranking tool impacts outcomes. In a setting with one high-valued candidate and\nan arbitrary number of low-valued candidates, we show that increased accuracy\nof the ranking tool can result in reduced social welfare. This can occur for\ntwo reasons: agents may be more likely to make offers to busy candidates, and\n(paradoxically) may be more likely to select lower-ranked candidates when\nrankings are more indicative of quality.

Given a fixed set of divisible and indivisible resources, we\ninvestigate almost envy-free allocations, captured by the natural fairness\nconcept of envy-freeness for mixed resources (EFM). It requires that an agent\n$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ if agent $j$'s bundle contains any piece of\ncake yielding positive utility to agent $i$ (i.e., envy-freeness), and agent\n$i$ is envy-free up to one item (EF1) towards agent $j$ otherwise.

Two motivating scenarios are: collaborative\nbidding among multiple distinct bidders managed by a third-party bidding agent,\nand strategic bid selection for multiple ad campaigns managed by a single\nadvertiser. We formalize this coordination problem as a theoretical model and\ndemonstrate that a straightforward coordination mechanism, where only the\nhighest-value bidder competes with outside bids, strictly dominates independent\nbidding, improving both Return-on-Spend (RoS) compliance and the total value\naccrued for each participating auto-bidder or ad campaign. Additionally, our\nsimulations on synthetic and real-world datasets support the theoretical result\nthat coordinated mechanism outperforms independent bidding. These findings\nhighlight both the theoretical potential and the practical robustness of\ncoordination in auto-bidding in online auctions."}

Each player deploys an agent at every location,\nand local interactions follow a Prisoner's Dilemma structure. We derive a\nsufficient condition that depends on the network diameter and the number of\nlocations, and analyze extreme cases of instantaneous, delayed, and\nproportionally delayed communication.
