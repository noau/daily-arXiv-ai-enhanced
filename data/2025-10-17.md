Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PoissonNet是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过局部-全局学习方案和泊松方程的特征传播机制，克服了现有网格学习方法在高频特征学习、感受野不足、离散化敏感性和计算效率等方面的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习方法在多个方面存在权衡缺陷，如高频特征学习难度大、感受野不足、对离散化敏感和计算效率低。PoissonNet的提出旨在克服这些缺陷。

Method: PoissonNet采用局部-全局学习框架，在网格的梯度域应用局部特征变换，并通过求解泊松系统在全局范围内传播特征更新。该方法高效且对网格三角化不敏感。

Result: PoissonNet在语义分割和高细节动画表面参数化任务中超越了现有方法，表现出卓越性能。此外，在表面变形学习任务中显著优于其他架构。

Conclusion: PoissonNet通过创新的局部-全局学习方案和泊松方程的特征传播机制，解决了现有网格学习方法的多重缺陷，并在多个任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

### [2] [HITrees: Higher-Order Interaction Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14558)
*Amir Mohammad Fadaei Ayyam,Michael Sammler*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持高阶效应的高阶交互树（HITrees），并通过两种关键技术实现，且在Lean证明助手中实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互树的效应不支持高阶效应，而高阶效应对于建模复杂语义特征（如并行组合和call/cc）至关重要。

Method: 设计效应概念以支持高阶输入，并使用反函数化技术编码高阶输出，从而在非保护类型理论中实现高阶交互树。

Result: 在Lean中实现HITrees，并提供包括并发、递归和call/cc在内的效应库，同时展示了其表达能力。

Conclusion: HITrees成功支持高阶效应，并在建模复杂语义特征时展现出强大的表达能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rise of compositional semantics as a
foundation for formal verification of complex systems. In particular,
interaction trees have emerged as a popular denotational semantics. Interaction
trees achieve compositionality by providing a reusable library of effects.
However, their notion of effects does not support higher-order effects, i.e.,
effects that take or return monadic computations. Such effects are essential to
model complex semantic features like parallel composition and call/cc.
  We introduce Higher-Order Interaction Trees (HITrees), the first variant of
interaction trees to support higher-order effects in a non-guarded type theory.
HITrees accomplish this through two key techniques: first, by designing the
notion of effects such that the fixpoints of effects with higher-order input
can be expressed as inductive types inside the type theory; and second, using
defunctionalization to encode higher-order outputs into a first-order
representation. We implement HITrees in the Lean proof assistant, accompanied
by a comprehensive library of effects including concurrency, recursion, and
call/cc. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of HITrees, as state
transition systems and as monadic programs. To demonstrate the expressiveness
of HITrees, we apply them to define the semantics of a language with parallel
composition and call/cc.

### [3] [Why Instant-Runoff Voting Is So Resilient to Coalitional Manipulation: Phase Transitions in the Perturbed Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14450)
*François Durand*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究发现，即时决选投票（IRV）在理论上和实证上都对联盟操纵（CM）具有很高的抵抗力，特别是在偏好集中的临界点θ_c=0时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明IRV对联盟操纵具有高度抵抗力，但其理论原因尚不清楚，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本研究分析了三种主要投票规则（多数制、两轮制和IRV）在Perturbed Culture模型中受联盟操纵的影响，并引入了超级孔多塞赢家（SCW）概念。

Result: 研究发现，每种投票规则在偏好集中的临界点θ_c处会发生相变：大型选民的CM概率在θ_c以下指数级趋近于1，在θ_c以上趋近于0。IRV的θ_c=0，表明其对CM的抵抗力极强。

Conclusion: IRV在理论上和实证上都表现出对联盟操纵的极高抵抗力，特别是在偏好集中的临界点θ_c=0时，这使得IRV成为高度可靠的投票规则。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

### [4] [Co-Investment under Revenue Uncertainty Based on Stochastic Coalitional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14555)
*Amal Sakr,Andrea Araldo,Tijani Chahed,Daniel Kofman*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对移动边缘计算（MEC）部署的联合投资方案，通过随机联盟博弈理论解决未来收益不确定性问题，并分析了联盟稳定性和盈利性的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘计算（MEC）等新服务的部署需要大量投资，单一利益相关者（如基础设施提供商）难以承担。通过联合投资方案，各利益相关者（如基础设施提供商和服务提供商）共同分担成本和收益，最大化各自收益。

Method: 提出了一种基于稳健博弈理论的随机联盟博弈框架，推导了大联盟稳定性的概率下界，并在收益波动较大的情况下引入盈利性作为联合投资的必要条件。

Result: 数值结果表明，当服务提供商的收益相近且投资周期足够长时，稳定性概率的下界较高；但在收益高度波动时，稳定性下界可能很低，但联合投资仍然具有盈利性。

Conclusion: 提出的联合投资方案在MEC部署中展示了可行性，尤其在收益相似和长期投资的情况下，能够实现高稳定性。但在收益高度波动时，盈利性条件更为关键。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

*Andrei Seoev,Leonid Gremyachikh,Anastasiia Smirnova,Yash Madhwal,Alisa Kalacheva,Dmitry Belousov,Ilia Zubov,Aleksei Smirnov,Denis Fedyanin,Vladimir Gorgadze,Yury Yanovich*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了区块链网络中交易排序策略（MEV）的优化，提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于在Polygon Atlas上的MEV提取，显著优于传统静态策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链网络中，MEV提取的竞争环境从公开竞价转变为密封竞价，时间紧迫且信息不完整，传统博弈论方法无法适应这种高频、部分可观察的环境。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，包括一个模拟Polygon Atlas拍卖环境的环境和一个基于PPO的实时竞价代理，能够在连续动作空间中制定自适应策略。

Result: 实验表明，该代理在与现有搜索者一起部署时捕获了49%的利润，替换市场领导者时捕获了81%的利润，显著优于静态策略。

Conclusion: 强化学习在高频MEV环境中具有关键优势，为工业参与者和协议设计者提供了即时价值。

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

*Javier Cembrano,Jose Correa,Svenja M. Griesbach,Victor Verdugo*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线环境下的立法机构席位分配问题，提出了一种无需未来信息的比例分配框架，并探讨了确定性和随机性在线分配方法的性能边界及其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的立法机构席位分配被视为一次性过程，忽略了动态因素的重要性。然而，在许多实际场景中，动态分配的需求显著。因此，论文旨在研究在线环境下的席位分配问题。

Method: 论文提出了一个离散时间的在线分配框架，其中每个时间步有n个政党根据得票比例分配席位。研究方法包括确定性和随机性算法，并分析了它们在最坏情况下的性能。

Result: 确定性方法在最坏情况下存在与n线性相关的偏差下界，但自然贪心方法能达到这一边界。此外，论文证明了当n≤3时，可实现全局配额的目标，并提出了一种基于递归网络的随机化分配方法。

Conclusion: 论文为在线席位分配问题提供了理论框架和方法，展示了其在依赖舍入过程中的应用潜力，同时揭示了确定性方法和随机方法的性能边界。

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

### [7] [Learnable Mixed Nash Equilibria are Collectively Rational](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14907)
*Geelon So,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了非渐进稳定性的博弈学习动态，通过均匀稳定性的概念揭示了其与集体理性的经济特性之间的紧密联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于将博弈学习动态扩展到非渐进稳定性领域，并探索其与经济集体理性之间的关系。

Method: 通过均匀稳定性的概念分析混合均衡的非渐进稳定性，并结合增量平滑最佳响应动态模型进行研究。

Result: 结果表明，在非退化条件下，非均匀稳定的混合均衡不具有弱帕累托最优性，而局部均匀稳定的均衡则具有弱帕累托最优性。此外，均匀稳定性决定了增量平滑最佳响应动态的最后迭代收敛行为。

Conclusion: 研究表明，个体效用最大化行为在混合纳什均衡附近会导致集体理性，这与严格均衡附近的动态行为不同。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.
