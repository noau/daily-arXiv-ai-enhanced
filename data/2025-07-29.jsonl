In scientific visualization,\nvolume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and\ninterpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have\ngained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant\nchallenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space\nradiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly\nenhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while\nmaintaining comparable computational efficiency."}

However, little attention has been given to the\nimmersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which\nremains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,\nto quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark\ndataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained\nphoto collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nexisting methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling\napplications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,\narchitectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing."}

Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance\nvideos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography\nstyles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To\naddress this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that\nuses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries\nbetween music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints\nimposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports\nstyle-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical\ngenres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to\nhandle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel\nmusic encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the\ngenerated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the\ninput music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match\nboth musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that\nmeasure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\ndimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style\nadherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of\ncreative applications.

The adaptive mechanism is driven by\nthe Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically\nestimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An\nexperimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based\non six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental\ngroups.

The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of\nthe discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the\nsystem, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity\nfilling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal\ninjection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix\nbased on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box.\nThe second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular\nareas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The\noptimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to\nthe center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology\nhas been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with\ncomplex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten\nplastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase.\nImportantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing\ntime and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design.

The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\n  We first show how to \"lift\" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem. The \"global\" step then utilizes the local one to find the\napproximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of\ncombinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted\nmatroid, and budgeted matching constraints.

Namely, one\ncan define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent\n$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip\nbetween their bundles that improves the value of $i$.\n  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is\ntwofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a\nstark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.\nFirst, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they\nfail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we\ncan achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a\ncommon ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination\ntechnique.
