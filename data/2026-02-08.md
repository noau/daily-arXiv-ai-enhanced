Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文分析了旋转位置编码（RoPE）的频率结构，揭示了其在高频成分主导的情况下可能导致参考内容复制的现象，并提出了一种选择性调制RoPE频段的方法，以实现稳定的共享注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中发现，现有基于变压器的生成模型中旋转位置编码（RoPE）在共享注意力和多模态设置下的行为尚未完全理解，尤其是在高频成分导致参考内容复制的问题上。

Method: 文章提出了一种选择性调制RoPE频率带的方法，通过调整频率成分的敏感度，使注意力计算更依赖于语义相似性而非严格的几何对齐。

Result: 实验表明该方法在现代基于变压器的扩散架构中有效恢复了稳定的共享注意力，实现了风格转移与内容复制之间的可控平衡。

Conclusion: 通过选择性调制RoPE的频率成分，研究成功解决了参考内容复制的问题，实现了仅转移参考图像风格而避免内容复制的生成过程。

Abstract: Positional encodings are essential to transformer-based generative models, yet their behavior in multimodal and attention-sharing settings is not fully understood. In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.

Conclusion: Gabor Fields为高斯基体积渲染提供了高效的层次表示和频率过滤方案，提升了性能和适用范围。

Abstract: Gaussian-based representations have enabled efficient physically-based volume rendering at a fraction of the memory cost of regular, discrete, voxel-based distributions. However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians.

Conclusion: 该框架成功地结合了理论稳定性分析和实用的GPU算法设计，实现了在单个GPU上可扩展、稳定且高分辨率的LBM模拟。

Abstract: In this work, we present a memory-efficient, high-performance GPU framework for moment-based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) with fluid-solid coupling. We introduce a split-kernel scheme that decouples fluid updates from solid boundary handling, substantially reducing warp divergence and improving utilization on GPUs. We further perform the first von Neumann stability analysis of the high-order moment-encoded LBM (HOME-LBM) formulation, characterizing its spectral behavior and deriving stability bounds for individual moment components. These theoretical insights directly guide a practical 16-bit moment quantization without compromising numerical stability. Our framework achieves up to 6x speedup and reduces GPU memory footprint by up to 50% in fluid-only scenarios and 25% in scenes with complex solid boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art LBM solver, while preserving physical fidelity across a range of large-scale benchmarks and real-time demonstrations. The proposed approach enables scalable, stable, and high-resolution LBM simulation on a single GPU, bridging theoretical stability analysis with practical GPU algorithm design.

### [4] [Monte Carlo Rendering to Diffusion Curves with Differential BEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05492)
*Ryusuke Sugimoto,Christopher Batty,Siddhartha Chaudhuri,Iliyan Georgiev,Toshiya Hachisuka,Kevin Wampler,Michal Lukáč*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从蒙特卡罗渲染器产生的噪声样本生成矢量图形（扩散曲线）的方法，填补了从3D几何形状稳健提取可编辑矢量图像的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前虽然可以通过蒙特卡罗光线追踪从3D几何形状生成栅格图像，但没有一种实用方法能够直接从3D几何形状提取带有着色信息的可编辑矢量图像。

Method: 该方法将问题表述为扩散曲线手柄的几何形状和颜色空间的随机优化问题，并通过Levenberg-Marquardt算法求解。其核心是一种新型微积分边界元方法（BEM）框架，可以重建颜色并计算参数的梯度。

Conclusion: 本文展示了该方法的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，并提出了理论和应用中尚未解决的问题。

Abstract: We present a method for generating vector graphics, in the form of diffusion curves, directly from noisy samples produced by a Monte Carlo renderer. While generating raster images from 3D geometry via Monte Carlo raytracing is commonplace, there is no corresponding practical approach for robustly and directly extracting editable vector images with shading information from 3D geometry. To fill this gap, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem over the space of geometries and colors of diffusion curve handles, and solve it with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. At the core of our method is a novel differential boundary element method (BEM) framework that reconstructs colors from diffusion curve handles and computes gradients with respect to their parameters, requiring the expensive matrix factorization only once at the beginning of the optimization. Unlike triangulation-based techniques that require a clean domain decomposition, our method is robust to geometrically challenging scenarios, such as intersecting diffusion curves, and to color noise in the target image, enabling the direct use of noisy Monte Carlo samples without requiring a converged, error-free input image. We demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach across several test cases. Finally, we highlight several open questions raised by our work, which spans both theory and applications.

### [5] [Doc2Spec: Synthesizing Formal Programming Specifications from Natural Language via Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04892)
*Shihao Xia,Mengting He,Haomin Jia,Linhai Song*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Doc2Spec是一个利用LLM自动从自然语言规则中推导规范语法并生成形式化规范的多智能体框架，提升了规范的可靠性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保API实现和使用符合自然语言编程规则对软件的正确性、安全性和可靠性至关重要，但手动编写精确的形式化规范困难且成本高。

Method: Doc2Spec利用LLM从自然语言规则中自动推导规范语法，并基于该语法生成形式化规范，语法捕捉了领域知识并约束规范空间。

Result: 在三个编程语言的七个基准测试中，Doc2Spec相比无语法推导的基线表现更优，并与手动编写语法的技术结果相当。

Conclusion: Doc2Spec通过自动化语法推导，有效实现了自然语言规则的形式化，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring that API implementations and usage comply with natural language programming rules is critical for software correctness, security, and reliability. Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules.

### [6] [Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528)
*Danel Ahman,Ilja Sobolev*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Ahman和Pretnar提出的异步效应的正规化性质，证明了在移除一般递归后，剩余演算（包括顺序和并行部分）是强正规化的。此外，顺序部分在重新引入受控的中断驱动递归行为后仍保持强正规化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补传统同步代数计算效应在处理异步性方面的不足，并为多重应用场景（如抢占式多线程、可取消的远程函数调用等）提供自然建模。

Method: 通过分解代数操作的执行信号与中断处理机制，构建核心演算，并在移除一般递归后研究其正规化性质。

Result: 证明了移除一般递归后的演算是强正规化的，并通过引入受控的中断驱动递归行为进一步优化了顺序部分的正规化结果。

Conclusion: 通过扩展Lindley和Stark的$\top\top$-提升方法，为异步效应语言提供了强正规化的证明，其结果在Agda中得到了形式化验证。

Abstract: Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.

### [7] [An Equational Axiomatization of Dynamic Threads via Algebraic Effects: Presheaves on Finite Relations, Labelled Posets, and Parameterized Algebraic Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05850)

Main category: cs.PL

Conclusion: 代数效应理论为动态线程的语义分析提供了有效的工具，参数化代数理论在并发模型中的应用展示了其强大的表达能力。

Abstract: We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.

Conclusion: 所提方法在计算效率、解质量和约束满足方面优于现有联合博弈求解器，为动态博弈提供了一种创新的均衡计算框架。

Abstract: Dynamic games are powerful tools to model multi-agent decision-making, yet computing Nash (generalized Nash) equilibria remains a central challenge in such settings. Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction.

### [9] [A Stronger Benchmark for Online Bilateral Trade: From Fixed Prices to Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05681)
*Anna Lunghi,Mattia Piccinato,Matteo Castiglioni,Alberto Marchesi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了在线双边交易中如何通过全局预算平衡约束提升社会福利，并提出首个在随机环境下实现亚线性遗憾的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前的研究表明，全局预算平衡约束可以显著提升社会福利，但现有基于每轮弱预算平衡的算法在此约束下表现不佳，因此需要新的算法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种能够在随机环境下实现亚线性遗憾的算法，特别是在评价联合分布密度有界时，算法达到了$\\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$的遗憾。

Result: 研究结果表明，在学习最优弱预算平衡价格的一维问题与学习最优全局预算平衡价格对的二维问题之间不存在分离。

Conclusion: 通过全局预算平衡约束，可以显著提升社会福利，新算法为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online bilateral trade, where a learner facilitates repeated exchanges between a buyer and a seller to maximize the Gain From Trade (GFT), i.e., the social welfare. In doing so, the learner must guarantee not to subsidize the market. This constraint is usually imposed per round through Weak Budget Balance (WBB). Despite that, Bernasconi et al. [2024] show that a Global Budget Balance (GBB) constraint on the profit -- enforced over the entire time horizon -- can improve the GFT by a multiplicative factor of two. While this might appear to be a marginal relaxation, this implies that all existing WBB-focused algorithms suffer linear regret when measured against the GBB optimum. In this work, we provide the first algorithm to achieve sublinear regret against the GBB benchmark in stochastic environments under one-bit feedback. In particular, we show that when the joint distribution of valuations has a bounded density, our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret. Our result shows that there is no separation between the one-dimensional problem of learning the optimal WBB price and the two-dimensional problem of learning the optimal GBB distribution over pairs of prices.

### [10] [Bandit Social Learning with Exploration Episodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05835)
*Kiarash Banihashem,Natalie Collina,Aleksandrs Slivkins*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了一种社会学习动态，其中自利代理通过多臂老虎机协议做出连续决策，发现集体探索失败且贝叶斯遗憾随时间线性增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自利代理在重复互动中的行为模式，如用户与AI交互或市场购物，理解集体探索失败的原因。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机协议，代理控制短序列决策（“集”），并分析集体探索的动态效果。

Result: 发现集体探索通常失败，贝叶斯遗憾随时间线性增长，即使个体在其集内进行探索。

Conclusion: 即使存在一定的有机探索，仍需外部驱动的探索来弥补集体探索的不足。

Abstract: We study a stylized social learning dynamics where self-interested agents collectively follow a simple multi-armed bandit protocol. Each agent controls an ``episode": a short sequence of consecutive decisions. Motivating applications include users repeatedly interacting with an AI, or repeatedly shopping at a marketplace. While agents are incentivized to explore within their respective episodes, we show that the aggregate exploration fails: e.g., its Bayesian regret grows linearly over time. In fact, such failure is a (very) typical case, not just a worst-case scenario. This conclusion persists even if an agent's per-episode utility is some fixed function of the per-round outcomes: e.g., $\min$ or $\max$, not just the sum. Thus, externally driven exploration is needed even when some amount of exploration happens organically.

Abstract: Hedonic games are fundamental models for investigating the formation of coalitions among a set of strategic agents, where every agent has a certain utility for every possible coalition of agents it can be part of. To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.
  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely.
