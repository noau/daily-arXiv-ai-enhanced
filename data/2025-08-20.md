*Yuyan Ye,Hang Xu,Yanghang Huang,Jiali Huang,Qian Weng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PreSem-Surf是一种基于神经辐射场（NeRF）框架的优化方法，能够从RGB-D序列中快速重建高质量场景表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该方法旨在通过整合RGB、深度和语义信息，提升场景重建的性能和效率。

Method: 采用SG-MLP采样结构和PR-MLP（预条件多层感知器）进行体素预渲染，并结合渐进式语义建模提取精确语义信息。

Result: 在七个合成场景和六个评估指标上的实验表明，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU上表现最佳，同时在NC、Accuracy和Completeness上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf展示了其高效性和实际应用价值，适用于高质量场景重建任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

### [2] [Sparse, Geometry- and Material-Aware Bases for Multilevel Elastodynamic Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13386)
*Ty Trusty,David I. W. Levin,Danny M. Kaufman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级弹性动力学时间步求解器，用于加速增量潜在接触（IPC）模拟，该方法在不牺牲视觉保真度的情况下保留了IPC的鲁棒性，并能显著提升计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在复杂几何形状、复杂非均质材料分布和高分辨率输入数据的场景下，保持IPC模拟的鲁棒性和视觉保真度，同时显著提升计算效率。

Method: 采用了一种新颖的稀疏、几何和材料感知的基构建方法，结合快速预条件共轭梯度求解器替代稀疏直接求解器，避免了收敛问题。

Result: 该方法在视觉和数值上与IPC黄金标准方法几乎无差别，但在相同硬件上可提升计算速度高达13倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的多级弹性动力学时间步求解器在保持IPC模拟高质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为解决复杂问题提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

### [3] [Eliminating Rasterization: Direct Vector Floor Plan Generation with DiffPlanner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13738)
*Shidong Wang,Renato Pajarola*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DiffPlanner的新型深度学习框架，直接在向量空间中处理边界约束的平面图生成问题，避免了传统方法中的信息丢失问题，并提供了更高的可控性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的平面图生成方法需要通过复杂的流程将矢量数据转换为栅格图像，再转换回矢量数据，导致信息丢失和冗余。DiffPlanner旨在解决这些问题，直接在向量空间中操作，提高生成质量和用户可控性。

Method: DiffPlanner是一种基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，结合了训练中的对齐机制，使模型能够处理复杂的矢量数据，并更好地拟合预测目标的分布。

Result: 实验表明，DiffPlanner在生成平面图和气泡图方面优于现有方法，提供了更高的可控性和更接近真实结果的质量。

Conclusion: DiffPlanner通过在向量空间中直接操作，避免了传统方法的信息丢失问题，显著提升了平面图生成的质量和用户可控性。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

### [4] [Sketch3DVE: Sketch-based 3D-Aware Scene Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13797)
*Feng-Lin Liu,Shi-Yang Li,Yan-Pei Cao,Hongbo Fu,Lin Gao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE是一种基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，用于处理视角变化显著的视频，通过点云编辑和深度图技术实现局部详细操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在风格转移或外观修改上表现良好，但在处理3D场景结构内容编辑时，尤其是面对大幅视角变化时，仍存在挑战。

Method: 利用图像编辑方法生成首帧编辑结果，并通过3D点云和深度图技术实现几何控制，结合3D感知掩码传播策略和视频扩散模型生成逼真的编辑视频。

Result: 实验证明Sketch3DVE在视频编辑中表现优异，能够有效处理视角变化并保持未编辑区域的完整性。

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE通过结合3D技术和用户友好的草图交互，为大幅视角变化的视频编辑提供了高效且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

### [5] [Is-NeRF: In-scattering Neural Radiance Field for Blurred Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13808)
*Nan Luo,Chenglin Ye,Jiaxu Li,Gang Liu,Bo Wan,Di Wang,Lupeng Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的去模糊神经辐射场（Is-NeRF），通过显式的光路建模和散射感知的体积渲染管线，解决了传统NeRF在处理复杂光路和运动模糊图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在处理复杂光路和运动模糊图像时存在几何模糊和训练挑战，无法捕捉真实环境中的精细光传播现象。

Method: 提出Is-NeRF，通过显式光路建模和散射感知的体积渲染管线，统一六种常见光传播现象，并引入自适应学习策略优化散射方向和采样间隔。

Result: 实验表明，Is-NeRF在复杂真实场景中表现出色，生成高保真图像并恢复精确几何细节，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过光路建模和自适应学习策略，显著提升了NeRF在处理复杂光路和去模糊任务中的性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

### [6] [Reactive Semantics for User Interface Description Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13610)
*Basile Pesin,Celia Picard,Cyril Allignol*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Smalite的核心反应式用户界面描述语言（UIDL）的指称语义模型，旨在为UIDL的形式化与验证奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广泛用于安全关键图形用户界面（GUI）开发的UIDL缺乏形式化和验证方面的研究，这成为研究的动机。

Method: 通过构建Smalite的指称语义模型，研究其表达能力，并探讨其在编码更复杂语言结构方面的潜力。

Result: 提出的Smalite模型具备足够的表达能力，能够编码更复杂语言的结构，为形式化验证的编译器开发提供可能。

Conclusion: Smalite的指称语义模型为UIDL的形式化与验证提供了初步基础，未来有望推动形式化验证编译器的开发。

Abstract: User Interface Description Languages (UIDLs) are high-level languages that
facilitate the development of Human-Machine Interfaces, such as Graphical User
Interface (GUI) applications. They usually provide first-class primitives to
specify how the program reacts to an external event (user input, network
message), and how data flows through the program. Although these
domain-specific languages are now widely used to implement safety-critical
GUIs, little work has been invested in their formalization and verification.
  In this paper, we propose a denotational semantic model for a core reactive
UIDL, Smalite, which we argue is expressive enough to encode constructs from
more realistic languages. This preliminary work may be used as a stepping stone
to produce a formally verified compiler for UIDLs.

### [7] [Bisimilarity and Simulatability of Processes Parameterized by Join Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13611)
*Clemens Grabmayer,Maurizio Murgia*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了参数化互模拟的自然弱化版本，即无限制连接交互互模拟，展示了其在确定性环境下与参数化互模拟的等价性，并研究了其在更广泛情况下的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于对Larsen的参数化互模拟概念的拓展，探讨其在更广泛环境中的应用，特别是通过引入无限制连接交互来弱化原有定义。

Method: 方法包括定义并比较参数化互模拟及其弱化版本（ji-参数化互模拟），并通过确定性化交互恢复原有概念；进一步研究了适应性模拟的前序关系。

Result: 结果显示ji-参数化互模拟在确定性环境下与参数化互模拟等价，但在一般情况下是一个更粗糙的等价关系；同时证明了参数化模拟与ji-参数化模拟的一致性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，通过确定性化交互可以恢复Larsen的概念，并展望了未来的研究方向。论文还提供了模态逻辑对(ji-)参数化模拟的表征。

Abstract: Departing from Larsen's concept of parameterized bisimilarity of processes
with respect to interaction with environments, we start an exploration of its
natural weakening: bisimilarity of unrestricted join interactions with
environments. Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect
to an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining --
respectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates
processes p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction
processes p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar. (Hereby join
interactions r & f facilitate a step with label a to r' & f' if and only if r
and f permit a-steps to r' and f' , respectively.) Join-interaction
parameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized
bisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser
equivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from
ji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions. We show that by
adaptation to simulatability (simulation preorder) the same concept arises:
parameterized simulatability coincides with ji-parameterized simulatability.
For the discrimination preorder of (ji-)parameterized simulatability on
environments we obtain the same result as Larsen did for parameterized
bisimilarity. Also, we give a modal-logic characterization of
(ji-)parameterized simulatability. Finally we gather open problems, and provide
an outlook on our current related work.

### [8] [Fair Division Among Couples and Small Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13432)
*Paul Gölz,Hannane Yaghoubizade*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究不可分割物品在小组间公平分配的问题，重点是小组成员（如两人小组）。对于两人小组，EF1分配总是存在并可高效找到；对于三人及以上小组，EF1分配不一定存在。同时，证明了PROPk分配在小组成员不超过k时总是存在并可高效实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不可分割物品在小组成员间的公平分配问题，特别是针对小组规模较小的情况，以解决实际生活中的合作与公平性问题。

Method: 研究两人小组（如夫妻）及稍大组（如三人小组）的分配问题，提出EF1和PROPk的概念，并设计高效算法实现这些分配方式。

Result: 对于两人小组，证明EF1分配总是存在且可高效找到；对于三人及以上小组，EF1分配可能不存在。同时，证明PROPk分配在小组成员不超过k时总是存在并可高效实现，且算法具有Pareto最优性。

Conclusion: 在小组成员较少的不可分割物品分配中，EF1和PROPk分配是可行的公平方案，但随小组规模增大，EF1分配变得不可行，而PROPk分配仍适用。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents,
where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on
groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1
allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than
the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found
efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most
$k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our
algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to
the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary
agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for
any number of couples.

### [9] [Reactive Users vs. Recommendation Systems: An Adaptive Policy to Manage Opinion Drifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13473)
*Atefeh Mollabagher,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户在推荐系统中的反应策略如何防止意见漂移，并通过理论分析和数值模拟验证了自适应策略的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通过个性化内容推广可能会影响用户的意见，本研究旨在探讨用户是否可以通过自适应调整内容消费策略来防止这种影响。

Method: 研究比较了两种随机策略：固定点击概率的被动策略和根据意见漂移调整点击概率的自适应策略，并通过理论分析和数值模拟验证了其效果。

Result: 研究显示，自适应策略能帮助用户防止意见漂移，且在用户优先考虑意见保持时，其性能优于固定策略。

Conclusion: 研究发现用户层面的策略可以挑战推荐系统引发的偏见，为理解用户如何应对推荐系统的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are used in a range of platforms to maximize user
engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content. It has
been found that such recommendations may shape users' opinions over time. In
this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence
of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting
their content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion
dynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the
probability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy
where clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.
We analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these
policies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion
drifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected
utility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our
theoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better
understand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by
recommendation systems.

### [10] [Optimal Candidate Positioning in Multi-Issue Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13841)
*Colin Cleveland,Bart de Keijzer,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多维空间选举中候选人的策略定位问题，证明了在单一对手情况下计算最佳新候选人位置是NP难问题，但对于固定数量的议题，问题可解，并提出了几何方法和近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了解决多维空间选举中候选人如何策略性地定位自己以获得最多选民支持的问题，尤其是在面对复杂的选民和对手分布时。

Method: 论文使用了基于$\(ackslash ell_p\)-范数的距离度量，通过超平面枚举算法和径向扫描方法（对于二维情况）来解决候选人定位问题，并扩展到多候选人和位置评分规则（如$k$-Approval和Borda）。

Result: 结果表明，计算新候选人的最优位置在单一对手情况下是NP难问题，但对于固定数量的议题可解。论文还提出了几何方法和近似保证，为竞选策略提供了实用的工具。

Conclusion: 该研究明确了多维空间选举的算法复杂性，并提供了可实现的几何工具，为竞选策略设计和分析提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study strategic candidate positioning in multidimensional spatial-voting
elections. Voters and candidates are represented as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
and each voter supports the candidate that is closest under a distance induced
by an $\ell_p$-norm. We prove that computing an optimal location for a new
candidate is NP-hard already against a single opponent, whereas for a constant
number of issues the problem is tractable: an $O(n^{d+1})$
hyperplane-enumeration algorithm and an $O(n \log n)$ radial-sweep routine for
$d=2$ solve the task exactly. We further derive the first approximation
guarantees for the general multi-candidate case and show how our geometric
approach extends seamlessly to positional-scoring rules such as $k$-approval
and Borda. These results clarify the algorithmic landscape of multidimensional
spatial elections and provide practically implementable tools for campaign
strategy.

### [11] [Control by Deleting Players from Weighted Voting Games Is NP^PP-Complete for the Penrose-Banzhaf Power Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13868)
*Joanna Kaczmarek,Jörg Rothe*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了加权投票游戏中通过删除玩家来控制玩家权力的复杂性，发现某些问题在概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数下对NP^PP类是完备的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加权投票游戏广泛用于模拟现实决策场景，但其通过删除玩家来控制玩家权力的复杂性尚未解决。

Method: 使用概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数作为衡量玩家权力的标准，分析删除玩家的控制问题。

Result: 发现这些问题对NP^PP类是完备的，显著提升了当前已知的复杂性下界。

Conclusion: 结果为实际应用中保护加权投票游戏免受SAT求解技术的影响提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Weighted voting games are a popular class of coalitional games that are
widely used to model real-life situations of decision-making. They can be
applied, for instance, to analyze legislative processes in parliaments or
voting in corporate structures. Various ways of tampering with these games have
been studied, among them merging or splitting players, fiddling with the quota,
and controlling weighted voting games by adding or deleting players. While the
complexity of control by adding players to such games so as to change or
maintain a given player's power has been recently settled, the complexity of
control by deleting players from such games (with the same goals) remained
open. We show that when the players' power is measured by the probabilistic
Penrose-Banzhaf index, some of these problems are complete for NP^PP -- the
class of problems solvable by NP machines equipped with a PP ("probabilistic
polynomial time") oracle. Our results optimally improve the currently known
lower bounds of hardness for much smaller complexity classes, thus providing
protection against SAT-solving techniques in practical applications.

Result: 论文提出的机制成功满足了Balanced Reciprocity Axiom，解决了数据和模型可复制性带来的公平分配问题，避免了策略性剥削和不公平分配。

Conclusion: 通过广义公平性公理和新机制的设计，论文为协作学习中数据和模型可复制性带来的公平分配问题提供了有效解决方案，确保了参与者之间的互惠公平性。

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.
