Abstract: This study explores the capabilities of WebGPU, an emerging web graphics
paradigm, for real-time cloth simulation. Traditional WebGL-based methods have
been in handling complex physical simulations due to their emphasis on graphics
rendering rather than general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) operations. WebGPU, designed
to provide modern 3D graphics and computational capabilities, offers
significant improvements through parallel processing and support for
computational shaders. In this work, we implemented a cloth simulation system
using the Mass-Spring Method within the WebGPU framework, integrating collision
detection and response handling with the 3D surface model. First, comparative
performance evaluations demonstrate that WebGPU substantially outperforms
WebGL, particularly in high-resolution simulations, maintaining 60 frames per
second (fps) even with up to 640K nodes. The second experiment aimed to
determine the real-time limitations of WebGPU and confirmed that WebGPU can
handle real-time collisions between 4K and 100k cloth node models and a 100K
triangle surface model in real-time. These experiments also highlight the
importance of balancing real-time performance with realistic rendering when
handling collisions between cloth models and complex 3D objects. Our source

### [2] [Measuring and predicting visual fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11857)
*Benjamin Watson,Alinda Friedman,Aaron McGaffey*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测量和预测视觉保真度的技术，使用两种简化算法处理多边形模型，并通过实验技术和自动技术评估其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是探索如何有效测量和预测视觉保真度，尤其是在使用不同简化算法的多边形模型中。

Method: 使用两种模型简化算法生成不同保真度的多边形模型，分为动物和人造物品两类。通过命名时间、评分和偏好三种实验技术测量保真度变化，并尝试用基于图像和模型的自动技术预测实验结果。

Result: 实验方法对简化类型和程度敏感，但不同方法对物体类型的响应有差异。自动技术能较好预测评分，但对偏好和命名时间的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: 论文提出改进实验和自动技术的建议，以提升视觉保真度的测量和预测效果。

Abstract: This paper is a study of techniques for measuring and predicting visual
fidelity. As visual stimuli we use polygonal models, and vary their fidelity
with two different model simplification algorithms. We also group the stimuli
into two object types: animals and man made artifacts. We examine three
different experimental techniques for measuring these fidelity changes: naming
times, ratings, and preferences. All the measures were sensitive to the type of
simplification and level of simplification. However, the measures differed from
one another in their response to object type. We also examine several automatic
techniques for predicting these experimental measures, including techniques
based on images and on the models themselves. Automatic measures of fidelity
were successful at predicting experimental ratings, less successful at
predicting preferences, and largely failures at predicting naming times. We
conclude with suggestions for use and improvement of the experimental and
automatic measures of visual fidelity.

### [3] [MOSPA: Human Motion Generation Driven by Spatial Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11949)

Conclusion: 研究填补了空间音频驱动人类动作生成的数据集和方法空白，为未来相关研究提供了基础。模型和数据集将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary
video for more details.

### [4] [HPR3D: Hierarchical Proxy Representation for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction and Controllable Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11971)
*Tielong Wang,Yuxuan Xiong,Jinfan Liu,Zhifan Zhang,Ye Chen,Yue Shi,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的3D分层代理节点表示法，克服了现有3D表示方法（如网格、体素、点云和NeRF）在通用性、编辑性和复杂性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示方法存在任务特异性、编辑复杂性和结构模糊性等问题，无法兼顾重建、生成、编辑和驱动等多种需求。

Method: 通过稀疏的分层组织（树结构）代理节点表示对象的形状和纹理，每个节点通过小型MLP隐式编码局部信息，并通过神经插值和轻量级解码实现高效查询。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D重建和编辑中表现出高效表达能力、高保真渲染质量和出色的可编辑性。

Conclusion: 提出的3D分层代理节点表示法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间取得了平衡，为3D表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

### [5] [SmokeSVD: Smoke Reconstruction from A Single View via Progressive Novel View Synthesis and Refinement with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12156)
*Chen Li,Shanshan Dong,Sheng Qiu,Jianmin Han,Zan Gao,Kemeng Huang,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SmokeSVD是一种高效框架，通过结合扩散模型和物理引导优化，从单视视频中逐步重建动态烟雾，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于稀疏视图覆盖导致3D信息严重不足，动态流体重建是一个长期存在的挑战性问题。现有方法在不适定条件下效率低下且效果有限。

Method: SmokeSVD首先使用扩散模型合成侧视图像，通过速度场指导生成一致的多视图像序列；随后通过迭代优化粗糙密度场，并最终利用Navier-Stokes方程重建精细密度场和速度场。

Result: 实验表明，SmokeSVD在定量和定性上均优于现有技术，实现了高质量的动态烟雾重建。

Conclusion: SmokeSVD通过结合生成能力和物理优化，有效解决了单视动态烟雾重建的挑战，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic fluids from sparse views is a long-standing and
challenging problem, due to the severe lack of 3D information from insufficient
view coverage. While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address
this issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are
often limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under
ill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an
efficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct
dynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative
capabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency
optimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically,
we first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion
models, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of
velocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent
side-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of
single-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints.
Subsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of
front-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry
novel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative
process that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing
novel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences.
Finally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity
field, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the
Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and outperforms
previous state-of-the-art techniques.

### [6] [Shape Adaptation for 3D Hairstyle Retargeting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12168)
*Lu Yu,Zhong Ren,Youyi Zheng,Xiang Chen,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动形状适应方法，用于将3D发型重新适配到新角色上，通过多尺度策略和约束优化问题来实现高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在游戏和VR应用中，为角色适配现有发型对艺术家来说是一项复杂且耗时的任务，因为需要保持复杂的头发几何形状和空间交互关系。

Method: 研究人员将适配过程表述为一个约束优化问题，并通过多尺度策略（从粗到细）计算头发丝的目标位置。此外，还提供了一种新的发际线编辑工具，通过基于物理的变形来重新分布发根。

Result: 通过定量和定性实验，在多种发型和角色上验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效且灵活地实现3D发型的自动适配，并为用户提供了定制化的编辑工具。

Abstract: It is demanding to author an existing hairstyle for novel characters in games
and VR applications. However, it is a non-trivial task for artists due to the
complicated hair geometries and spatial interactions to preserve. In this
paper, we present an automatic shape adaptation method to retarget 3D
hairstyles. We formulate the adaptation process as a constrained optimization
problem, where all the shape properties and spatial relationships are converted
into individual objectives and constraints. To make such an optimization on
high-resolution hairstyles tractable, we adopt a multi-scale strategy to
compute the target positions of the hair strands in a coarse-to-fine manner.
The global solving for the inter-strands coupling is restricted to the coarse
level, and the solving for fine details is made local and parallel. In
addition, we present a novel hairline edit tool to allow for user customization
during retargeting. We achieve it by solving physics-based deformations of an
embedded membrane to redistribute the hair roots with minimal distortion. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method through quantitative and qualitative
experiments on various hairstyles and characters.

### [7] [Quantum circuits are just a phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11676)
*Chris Heunen,Louis Lemonnier,Christopher McNally,Alex Rice*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种新型的量子编程语言，通过结合全局相位操作和量子版的“if let”构造，提升量子编程的抽象性和表达力，支持更高级的推理和算法设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子编程的抽象级别过低，类似于汇编语言的量子电路描述方式阻碍了扩展性、清晰度和高级推理支持。因此，需要更抽象和表达的量子编程构造。

Method: 提出了一种新型量子编程语言，结合全局相位操作和量子版“if let”构造，聚焦于特征分解、共轭和控制酉操作。同时实现了原型编译器，将语言转换为量子电路。

Result: 展示了语言的表达力，包括通用量子门集的推导、重要量子算法的自然表达（如Grover搜索算法、量子傅里叶变换等），并提供了基于范畴量子力学的语义解释。

Conclusion: 这种构造为量子编程提供了更抽象和结构化的方法，兼具原则性和实用性。

Abstract: Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum
circuits akin to assembly languages - and even advanced quantum programming
languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of
affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning.
More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed.
  To this end, we introduce a novel yet simple quantum programming language for
generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation
that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct
that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language
lifts the focus from quantum gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and
controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design.
  We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in
several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by
deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum
algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search
algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal
Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give
clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics.
Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of
our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to
these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct
offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured
quantum programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在展示Picat作为一种多范式编程语言在解决特定类型问题（如逆向工程和路径查找）中的优势，尤其是在需要高效约束求解和表格功能的场景下。

Method: 论文通过解决Advent of Code 2024中的多个问题，展示了Picat的内置约束求解、模式匹配、回溯和动态表格功能如何实现简洁且高效的解决方案。

Result: 研究结果表明，Picat的SAT-based约束求解和表格功能能够以更简洁、声明式的方式高效解决问题，这些问题在命令式语言中需要更多努力才能实现。

Conclusion: Picat因其独特的功能在多范式编程中表现出色，特别适合需要高效约束求解和表格功能的复杂问题。

Abstract: Picat is a logic-based, multi-paradigm programming language that integrates
features from logic, functional, constraint, and imperative programming
paradigms. This paper presents solutions to several problems from the 2024
Advent of Code (AoC). While AoC problems are not designed for any specific
programming language, certain problem types, such as reverse engineering and
path-finding, are particularly well-suited to Picat due to its built-in
constraint solving, pattern matching, backtracking, and dynamic programming
with tabling. This paper demonstrates that Picat's features, especially its
SAT-based constraint solving and tabling, enable concise, declarative, and
highly efficient implementations of problems that would require significantly
more effort in imperative languages.

### [9] [Universal Synthesis of Differentiably Tunable Numerical Abstract Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11827)

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用的转换器合成算法，用于为多面体数值域和具体的二次有界保护操作符（QGO）类操作构造参数化的抽象转换器家族，解决了现有数值抽象解释器的扩展性和组合性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 论文的通用合成算法成功构建了跨域的抽象转换器家族，USTAD框架通过组合推理和梯度引导的转换器空间遍历，显著提升了分析精度。

Abstract: Numerical abstract interpretation is a widely used framework for the static
analysis of numerical programs. However, existing numerical abstract
interpreters rely on hand-crafted, instruction-specific transformers tailored
to each domain, with no general algorithm for handling common operations across
domains. This limits extensibility, prevents precise compositional reasoning
over instruction sequences, and forces all downstream tasks to use the same
fixed transformer regardless of their precision, efficiency, or task-specific
requirements. To address these limitations, we propose a universal transformer
synthesis algorithm that constructs a parametric family of sound abstract
transformers for any given polyhedral numerical domain and a concrete operator
from the class of Quadratic-Bounded Guarded Operators (QGO), which includes
both individual instructions and structured sequences. Each instantiation in
this family is sound by construction, enabling downstream analyses to adapt the
transformer to their particular needs. The space of transformers is
differentiable but complex. To efficiently explore this space of transformers,
we introduce the Adaptive Gradient Guidance (AGG) procedure, a gradient-guided
search strategy that steers the search process based on downstream analysis
objectives and runtime constraints. We implement these ideas in the USTAD
framework and evaluate their effectiveness across three numerical abstract
domains: Zones, Octagons, and Polyhedra. Our results demonstrate that the
universal synthesis algorithm successfully constructs sound families of
transformers across domains, and that USTAD achieves significant, tunable
precision gains over baselines by leveraging compositional reasoning and
efficient gradient-guided traversal of the transformer space.

### [11] [New allocation rule based on graph structures and their application to economic phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11808)
*Taiki Yamada,Taisuke Matsubae,Tomoya Akamatsu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于边的Shapley值分配规则，专为网络系统设计，通过边集评估贡献，解决了传统规则无法捕捉边功能角色的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分配规则（如Shapley和Myerson值）基于节点级别评估贡献，但未能充分反映边在供应链和数字平台等系统中的关键作用。

Method: 研究将特征函数从节点集转移到边集，提出基于边的Shapley值，保留了公平性和对称性等关键特性。

Result: 该框架在内容平台网络和供应链物流（SCL）应用中表现直观且结构一致，尤其在重叠路径、独占合同或成本敏感路径场景中。

Conclusion: 这一方法为具有复杂交互结构的合作场景提供了新的价值归因视角，并提供了分析现实经济和物流网络的实用工具。

Abstract: This study introduces the \emph{edge-based Shapley value}, a novel allocation
rule within cooperative game theory, specifically tailored for networked
systems, where value is generated through interactions represented by edges.
Traditional allocation rules, such as the Shapley and Myerson values, evaluate
player contributions based on node-level characteristics, or connected
components. However, these approaches often fail to adequately capture the
functional role of edges, which are crucial in systems such as supply chains
and digital platforms, where interactions, rather than individual agents, are
the primary drivers of value. Our edge-based Shapley value shifts the
characteristic function from node sets to edge sets, thereby enabling a more
granular and context-sensitive evaluation of the contributions. We establish
its theoretical foundations, demonstrate its relationship to classical
allocation rules, and show that it retains key properties such as fairness and
symmetry. To illustrate its applicability, we present two use cases: content
platform networks and supply chain logistics (SCL). In both cases, our method
produces intuitive and structurally consistent allocations, particularly in
scenarios with overlapping routes, exclusive contracts or cost-sensitive paths.
This framework offers a new perspective on value attribution in cooperative
settings with complex interaction structures and provides practical tools for
analyzing real-world economic and logistical networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决动态环境中玩家的联盟形成问题，并设计一种策略使玩家在贪婪行为下仍能最大化社会福利。

Method: 论文分析了单调且有界的合作游戏，提出了一种不可撤销的策略，并证明了其竞争比的上界，同时提出了一种接近最优的策略。

Result: 主要结果为不可撤销策略的竞争比上界为$\frac{3\mathsf{min}}{\mathsf{max}}$，并提出了一种竞争比为$\min\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3\mathsf{min}}{\mathsf{max}}\right\}$的策略。

Conclusion: 结论表明，即使在玩家行为贪婪的条件下，仍然可以设计出接近最优的策略来最大化社会福利。同时，论文还探讨了非不可撤销策略的局限性。

Abstract: In this work, we examine a sequential setting of a cooperative game in which
players arrive dynamically to form coalitions and complete tasks either
together or individually, depending on the value created. Upon arrival, a new
player as a decision maker faces two options: forming a new coalition or
joining an existing one. We assume that players are greedy, i.e., they aim to
maximize their rewards based on the information available at their arrival. The
objective is to design an online value distribution policy that incentivizes
players to form a coalition structure that maximizes social welfare. We focus
on monotone and bounded cooperative games. Our main result establishes an upper
bound of $\frac{3\mathsf{min}}{\mathsf{max}}$ on the competitive ratio for any
irrevocable policy (i.e., one without redistribution), and proposes a policy
that achieves a near-optimal competitive ratio of $\min\left\{\frac{1}{2},
\frac{3\mathsf{min}}{\mathsf{max}}\right\}$, where $\mathsf{min}$ and
$\mathsf{max}$ denote the smallest and largest marginal contribution of any
sub-coalition of players respectively. Finally, we also consider
non-irrevocable policies, with alternative bounds only when the number of
players is limited.

Abstract: This paper explores the economic interactions within modern crowdsourcing
markets. In these markets, employers issue requests for tasks, platforms
facilitate the recruitment of crowd workers, and workers complete tasks for
monetary rewards. Recognizing that these roles serve distinct functions within
the ecosystem, we introduce a three-party model that distinguishes among the
principal (the requester), the intermediary (the platform), and the pool of
agents (the workers). The principal, unable to directly engage with agents,
relies on the intermediary to recruit and incentivize them. This interaction
unfolds in two stages: first, the principal designs a profit-sharing contract
with the intermediary; second, the intermediary implements a mechanism to
select an agent to complete the delegated task.
  We analyze the proposed model as an extensive-form Stackelberg game. Our
contributions are fourfold: (1) We fully characterize the subgame perfect
equilibrium. In particular, we reduce the principal's contract design problem
to a novel auction-theoretic formulation we term virtual value pricing, and
reveals that linear contracts are optimal even when the task have multiple
outcomes and agents' cost distributions are asymmetric. (2) To quantify the
principal's utility loss from delegation and information asymmetry, we
introduce the price of double marginalization (PoDM) and the classical price of
anarchy (PoA), and derive tight or nearly tight bounds on both ratios under
regular and monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions. (3) We further examine
these two ratios in a natural setting where the intermediary is restricted to
anonymous pricing mechanisms, and show that similar qualitative insights
continue to hold. (4) Finally, we extend our results on both ratios to a robust
framework that accommodates scenarios in which the principal lacks precise
information about the market size.
