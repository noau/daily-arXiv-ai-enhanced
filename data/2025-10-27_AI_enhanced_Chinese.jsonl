To address these limitations,\nwe propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural\nConstitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial\ndifferential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs\ntwo separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.\nSimultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional\ninputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios\nwith varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across\ndifferent properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.\nFurthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its\nexplicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical\nparameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our\nframework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties.

Classical models of shift bribery assume voters\nact independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in\nreality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a\nsocial network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby\namplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,\nwhere voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs\nrepresent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not\nconfined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the\nnetwork, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and\nindividual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a\ndesignated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists\nwithin budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and\nnetwork-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is\nNP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when\nparameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design\npolynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority\nrules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for\ntransitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform\narc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further\nprove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as\nparameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and\npseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform\narc weights.

We first show that when dynamics and rewards are\nLipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate\n$\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous\nsetting, we prove the same $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the\nimportant special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in\ndynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel\napproximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive\nDesign (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated\nequilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting\napproximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,\nscalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID.

Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely\nemployed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional\nknowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for\ncorrelated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise\nmaximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By\nincorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a\nprecise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In\nthe entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy\nguarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the\nindividual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper\nbound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize\nthat PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to\nadequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets.
