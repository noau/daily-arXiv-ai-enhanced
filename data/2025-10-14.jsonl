It is usually verified at the source level\n(e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers\n(e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However,\nmodern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving\nend-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the\nsafe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified\ncompilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at\nthe target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors)\nare automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for\nmodules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to\ncooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety.\n  To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of\nsafety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled\ntransition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules\nand can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those\nproperties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and\ncomposition of the safety results at the target level.

Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce\ntemporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the\nsequence of agents $\\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for\nrethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is\nthe incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in\nthe order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional\nproperties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents\nto invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the\ntotal worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify\na class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three\nproperties.

Our approach utilizes a\nvision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the\ngeneration process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual\nconcepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We\nevaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical\nmetrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show\nconsistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.\nMoreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our\napproach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of\ncreative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional\nprompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,\noffering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond\nthe constraints of textual descriptions."}

Even small\ninefficiencies in the allocators ripple through caches and the rest of the\nmemory hierarchy, collectively imposing what operators often call a \"datacenter\ntax\". At hyperscale, even a 1% improvement in allocator efficiency can unlock\nmillions of dollars in savings and measurable reductions in datacenter energy\nconsumption. Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed\nand memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex\nmetadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead\nintroduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design.\nNotably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which\ncontinue to be widely used across diverse application domains.\n  In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built\nfor single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded\nexecution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control\nflow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core\ndesign features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a\nbalanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally,\nExgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded\nallocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as\ndlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both\nsystems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over\ndlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In\naddition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory\nsavings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench,\nrespectively."}

Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization\npipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the\ninput volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the\nmedial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic\nerror metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,\nwhile a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.\nCompared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach\nproduces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly\nimproved mesh quality.

Recent approaches employ\ncode-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such\npair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often\nlead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance\nreasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code\noptimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from\nreference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency\nand the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code,\nECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck\ndiagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related\nROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt,\nproviding actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic,\nrequire no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our\nempirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves\ncode-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to\n7.81x while minimizing correctness loss."}

However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly\npermissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only\nrecently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable\nObjects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on\nRDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming.\nLOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality\nand the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance\ncomparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far\nsimpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support\nverification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework,\ncalled Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is\nindependent of a memory consistency model.

Recently, a\nnew class of tools, called speculative constant-time (SCT) tools, has also been\nused for detecting potential Spectre vulnerabilities. In many cases, these SCT\ntools have emerged as liftings of CT tools. However, these liftings are seldom\ndefined precisely and are almost never analyzed formally. The goal of this\npaper is to address this gap, by developing formal foundations for these\nliftings, and to demonstrate that these foundations can yield practical\nbenefits.\n  Concretely, we introduce a program transformation, coined Speculation-Passing\nStyle (SPS), for reducing SCT verification to CT verification. Essentially, the\ntransformation instruments the program with a new input that corresponds to\nattacker-controlled predictions and modifies the program to follow them. This\napproach is sound and complete, in the sense that a program is SCT if and only\nif its SPS transform is CT. Thus, we can leverage existing CT verification\ntools to prove SCT; we illustrate this by combining SPS with three standard\nmethodologies for CT verification, namely reducing it to non-interference,\nassertion safety and dynamic taint analysis. We realize these combinations with\nthree existing tools, EasyCrypt, BINSEC, and ctgrind, and we evaluate them on\nKocher's benchmarks for Spectre-v1. Our results focus on Spectre-v1 in the\nstandard CT leakage model; however, we also discuss applications of our method\nto other variants of Spectre and other leakage models."}
