### [1] [Making Graphs Irregular through Irregularising Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21254)
*Julien Bensmail,Romain Bourneuf,Paul Colinot,Samuel Humeau,Timothée Martinod*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 研究在1-2-3猜想基础上，限制新增边必须形成路径的图论问题，探讨其结构、组合及算法性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将图转化为局部不规则多重图时，限制新增边必须形成路径的性质及最短路径长度。

Method: 引入路径限制条件，研究其对一般图及特定图类的影响，分析结构、组合及算法问题。

Result: 提供了关于最短不规则路径长度的多类结果，包括结构、组合和算法性质。

Conclusion: 路径限制下的1-2-3猜想扩展问题具有丰富的理论性质，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The 1-2-3 Conjecture, introduced by Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak, and Thomason in
2004, was recently solved by Keusch. This implies that, for any connected graph
$G$ different from $K_2$, we can turn $G$ into a locally irregular multigraph
$M(G)$, i.e., in which no two adjacent vertices have the same degree, by
replacing some of its edges with at most three parallel edges. In this work, we
introduce and study a restriction of this problem under the additional
constraint that edges added to $G$ to reach $M(G)$ must form a walk (i.e., a
path with possibly repeated edges and vertices) of $G$. We investigate the
general consequences of having this additional constraint, and provide several
results of different natures (structural, combinatorial, algorithmic) on the
length of the shortest irregularising walks, for general graphs and more
restricted classes.

Abstract: Snake is a classic computer game, which has been around for decades. Based on
this game, we study the game of Snake on arbitrary undirected graphs. A snake
forms a simple path that has to move to an apple while avoiding colliding with
itself. When the snake reaches the apple, it grows longer, and a new apple
appears. A graph on which the snake has a strategy to keep eating apples until
it covers all the vertices of the graph is called snake-winnable. We prove that
determining whether a graph is snake-winnable is NP-hard, even when restricted
to grid graphs. We fully characterize snake-winnable graphs for odd-sized
bipartite graphs and graphs with vertex-connectivity 1. While Hamiltonian
graphs are always snake-winnable, we show that non-Hamiltonian snake-winnable
graphs have a girth of at most 6 and that this bound is tight.

### [3] [Adaptive Hybrid Sort: Dynamic Strategy Selection for Optimal Sorting Across Diverse Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20677)
*Shrinivass Arunachalam Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自适应混合排序范式，根据输入数据的实时模式选择最有效的排序算法（Counting Sort、Radix Sort或QuickSort），显著提升了执行时间和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有排序算法无法在所有数据分布下都表现最优，因此需要一种能根据数据特征动态选择最优算法的自适应排序方案。

Method: 该方法通过特征提取模块分析数据的关键参数（如数据量、值范围和熵），并使用有限状态机和XGBoost分类器动态选择最优排序算法。

Result: 实验证明，该框架在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，执行时间、灵活性和效率优于传统静态排序算法。

Conclusion: 该自适应混合排序框架具有高度可扩展性和广泛适用性，适用于大数据分析、边缘计算等场景。

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

### [4] [Review of Three Variants of the k-d Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20687)
*Russell A. Brown*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文探讨了构建平衡k-d树的不同技术，对比了三种分区方法的性能，并提出并分析了其中一种方法的双线程执行方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于k-d树无法使用传统的平衡技术（如AVL树或红黑树），需要通过找到中位数并分区来实现平衡。不同分区方法对构建k-d树的计算复杂度有重要影响。

Method: 研究对比了三种k-d树的变体，分别采用不同的分区技术，并对比了它们的性能。此外，还提出并分析了其中一种变体的双线程执行方案。

Result: 通过对比三种分区方法，得出它们对k-d树构建复杂度的不同影响。双线程执行方案被证明对提升性能有潜力。

Conclusion: 构建k-d树的分区技术对其效率至关重要，双线程执行是一种可行的优化方向。

Abstract: The original description of the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing
techniques, such as used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not
applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to find the median of a set of data for each recursive subdivision of
that set. The sort or selection used to find the median, and the technique used
to partition the set about that median, strongly influence the computational
complexity of building a k-d tree. This article describes and contrasts three
variants of the k-d tree that differ in their technique used to partition the
set, and compares the performance of those variants. In addition, dual-threaded
execution is proposed and analyzed for one of the three variants.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Covering and partitioning the edges of a graph into cliques are classical
problems at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and graph theory,
having been studied through a range of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic
lenses. Despite the well-known fixed-parameter tractability of these problems
when parameterized by the total number of cliques, such a parameterization
often fails to be meaningful for sparse graphs. In many real-world instances,
on the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition
can be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \alpha(G).
  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \alpha parameterizations
of the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and
study Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\alpha) and Edge Clique
Partition Above Independent Set (ECP/\alpha), where the goal is to cover or
partition all edges of a graph using at most \alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is
the parameter. Our main results reveal a distinct complexity landscape for the
two variants. We show that ECP/\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas
ECC/\alpha is NP-complete for all k \geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial
time for k \in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between
the two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a
natural lower bound.
  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by k + \omega(G), where \omega(G) is the size of a maximum
clique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs,
in which \omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a
subexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}.

### [6] [A Framework for Building Data Structures from Communication Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20761)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a general framework for designing efficient data structures for
high-dimensional pattern-matching problems ($\exists \;? i\in[n], f(x_i,y)=1$)
through communication models in which $f(x,y)$ admits sublinear communication
protocols with exponentially-small error. Specifically, we reduce the data
structure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication
complexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.
  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with
wildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.
When the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of
$\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\log n \;(\ll d)$, the fastest known
linear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query
time $t \approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$. By contrast,
our framework produces a data structure with query time $n^{1-1/(c \log^2 c)}$
and space close to linear.
  To achieve this, we develop a one-sided $\epsilon$-error communication
protocol for Set-Disjointness under product distributions with
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\log(1/\epsilon)})$ complexity, improving on the
classical result of Babai, Frankl and Simon (FOCS'86). Building on this
protocol, we show that the Unambiguous AM communication complexity of
$w$-Sparse Set-Disjointness with $\epsilon$-error under product distributions
is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{w \log(1/\epsilon)})$, independent of the ambient dimension
$d$, which is crucial for the Partial Match result. Our framework sheds further
light on the power of data-dependent data structures, which is instrumental for
reducing to the (much easier) case of product distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种能够灵活编辑生成图像场景的方法，通过几何抽象实现高效操纵，同时保持纹理一致性。

Method: 将场景表示为3D凸基元组合，支持不同精度编辑，采用基于流的图像生成方法，结合深度和纹理提示。

Result: 在视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何抽象和纹理提示，实现了高保真且灵活的生成图像编辑。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

Method: 系统回顾了37篇研究论文，分类分析了五个关键领域：可视化工具的使用演变、动机、金融主题与教学法、工具与技术类型、教学干预效果评估。

Result: 研究发现可视化工具在金融教育中具有潜力，但也存在研究空白，需进一步探索。

Conclusion: 研究为教育者和专业人士提供了实用建议，以设计和利用视觉工具提升金融素养。

Abstract: Financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed and effective
financial decisions, improving their overall financial well-being and security.
However, for many people understanding financial concepts can be daunting and
only half of US adults are considered financially literate. Data visualization
simplifies these concepts, making them accessible and engaging for learners of
all ages. This systematic review analyzes 37 research papers exploring the use
of data visualization and visual analytics in financial education and literacy
enhancement. We classify these studies into five key areas: (1) the evolution
of visualization use across time and space, (2) motivations for using
visualization tools, (3) the financial topics addressed and instructional
approaches used, (4) the types of tools and technologies applied, and (5) how
the effectiveness of teaching interventions was evaluated. Furthermore, we
identify research gaps and highlight opportunities for advancing financial
literacy. Our findings offer practical insights for educators and professionals
to effectively utilize or design visual tools for financial literacy.

Motivation: 现有纹理合成方法因缺乏全局上下文和几何理解，导致纹理不一致，而视频生成模型在时间一致性上表现出色。

Conclusion: VideoTex为需要视觉质量和时间一致性的动态实时应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线广告系统向自动竞价过渡，研究不同拍卖形式下的价格无政府状态（POA）变得尤为重要。本文旨在扩展平滑框架以更好地分析自动竞价中的异质代理行为。

Method: 扩展了Syrgkanis和Tardos的平滑框架，提出了平衡异质代理类型平滑参数的技术，并通过数学程序揭示了最佳的POA界限。证明了单物品第一价格拍卖的平滑性，并展示了其在多种模型中的适用性。

Result: 通过该方法，成功证明了混合自动竞价中紧致的POA界限（如2.18），并在超越现有技术的模型中建立了首个（大多）紧致的POA界限。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅简化了自动竞价中POA的分析，还扩展了其适用范围，并能处理粗粒度相关均衡（CCE），为自动竞价的理论研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding,
enabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each
advertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective
subject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their
relevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare
price of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which
simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of
heterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA
bounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for
mixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for
additive valuations.
  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to
autobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters
across heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving
a POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)
Simplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous
FPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and
utility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)
Extendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve
prices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous
payment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first
(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of
the art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated
equilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing
algorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from
such agents have properties that keep their POA low.

Result: 证明d-多重分配可以转化为常规分配，损失不超过d倍价值，并推导出公平分配的新结果。

Conclusion: 通过转化方法，证明了在特定条件下存在接近公平的分配方案，扩展了现有研究的适用范围。

Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$
agents with monotone subadditive valuations. For integer $d \ge 2$, a
$d$-multi-allocation is an allocation in which each item is allocated to at
most $d$ different agents. We show that $d$-multi-allocations can be
transformed into allocations, while not losing much more than a factor of $d$
in the value that each agent receives. One consequence of this result is that
for allocation instances with equal entitlements and subadditive valuations, if
$\rho$-MMS $d$-multi-allocations exist, then so do $\frac{\rho}{4d}$-MMS
allocations. Combined with recent results of Seddighin and Seddighin [EC 2025],
this implies the existence of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$-MMS allocations.

Abstract: Analyzing refutations of the well known 0pebbling formulas Peb$(G)$ we prove
some new strong connections between pebble games and algebraic proof system,
showing that there is a parallelism between the reversible, black and
black-white pebbling games on one side, and the three algebraic proof systems
Nullstellensatz, Monomial Calculus and Polynomial Calculus on the other side.
In particular we prove that for any DAG $G$ with a single sink, if there is a
Monomial Calculus refutation for Peb$(G)$ having simultaneously degree $s$ and
size $t$ then there is a black pebbling strategy on $G$ with space $s$ and time
$t+s$. Also if there is a black pebbling strategy for $G$ with space $s$ and
time $t$ it is possible to extract from it a MC refutation for Peb$(G)$ having
simultaneously degree $s$ and size $ts$. These results are analogous to those
proven in {deRezende et al.21} for the case of reversible pebbling and
Nullstellensatz. Using them we prove degree separations between NS, MC and PC,
as well as strong degree-size tradeoffs for MC.
  We also notice that for any directed acyclic graph $G$ the space needed in a
pebbling strategy on $G$, for the three versions of the game, reversible, black
and black-white, exactly matches the variable space complexity of a refutation
of the corresponding pebbling formula Peb$(G)$ in each of the algebraic proof
systems NS, MC and PC. Using known pebbling bounds on graphs, this connection
implies separations between the corresponding variable space measures.

Abstract: We study the problem of deciding whether a point escapes a closed subset of
$\mathbb{R}^d$ under the iteration of a continuous map $f \colon \mathbb{R}^d
\to \mathbb{R}^d$ in the bit-model of real computation. We give a sound partial
decision method for this problem which is complete in the sense that its
halting set contains the halting set of all sound partial decision methods for
the problem. Equivalently, our decision method terminates on all problem
instances whose answer is robust under all sufficiently small perturbations of
the function. We further show that the halting set of our algorithm is dense in
the set of all problem instances. While our algorithm applies to general
continuous functions, we demonstrate that it also yields complete decision
methods for much more rigid function families: affine linear systems and
quadratic complex polynomials. In the latter case, completeness is subject to
the density of hyperbolicity conjecture in complex dynamics. This in particular
yields an alternative proof of Hertling's (2004) conditional answer to a
question raised by Penrose (1989) regarding the computability of the Mandelbrot
set.

proof is replaced by a numeric sequence. Only the values corresponding to the
axioms have to be computed from scratch. The values corresponding to derived
formulas are computed from the values corresponding to their ancestors by
applying the homomorphic properties. On such sequences, various Zero Knowledge
methods can be applied.

Abstract: The concept of Galois connections (i.e., adjoint pairs between posets) is
ubiquitous in mathematics. In representation theory, it is interesting because
it naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of
persistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of
central subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to
understand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a
class of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a
full subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its
corresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint
quadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the
contraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction
functor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an
adjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we
introduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems,
and prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve
interval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval
covers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions
for certain classes of finite posets.

Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the
outer automorphism groups of the finite groups belonging to a family
$\mathscr{U}$. These arise in classical representation theory, in the study of
representation stability, as well as in global homotopy theory. In this paper
we begin a systematic study of the derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U};k)$
of global representations over fields $k$ of characteristic zero, from the
point-of-view of tensor-triangular geometry. We calculate its Balmer spectrum
for various infinite families of finite groups including elementary abelian
$p$-groups, cyclic groups, and finite abelian $p$-groups of bounded rank. We
then deduce that the Balmer spectrum associated to the family of finite abelian
$p$-groups has infinite Krull dimension and infinite Cantor--Bendixson rank,
illustrating the complex phenomena we encounter. As a concrete application, we
provide a complete tt-theoretic classification of finitely generated derived
VI-modules. Our proofs rely on subtle information about the growth behaviour of
global representations studied in a companion paper, as well as novel methods
from non-rigid tt-geometry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The aim of this article is to give a complete proof of results of
Harish-Chandra linking the irreducibility of parabolic induction of a
supercuspidal representation of a p-adic group to the analytic behavior of the
mu-function of Harish-Chandra and to show that the proof remains valid in the
case of a central extension.
