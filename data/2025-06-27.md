TL;DR: 研究在1-2-3猜想基础上，限制新增边必须形成路径的图论问题，探讨其结构、组合及算法性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将图转化为局部不规则多重图时，限制新增边必须形成路径的性质及最短路径长度。

Method: 引入路径限制条件，研究其对一般图及特定图类的影响，分析结构、组合及算法问题。

Result: 提供了关于最短不规则路径长度的多类结果，包括结构、组合和算法性质。

Conclusion: 路径限制下的1-2-3猜想扩展问题具有丰富的理论性质，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The 1-2-3 Conjecture, introduced by Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak, and Thomason in
2004, was recently solved by Keusch. This implies that, for any connected graph
$G$ different from $K_2$, we can turn $G$ into a locally irregular multigraph
$M(G)$, i.e., in which no two adjacent vertices have the same degree, by
replacing some of its edges with at most three parallel edges. In this work, we
introduce and study a restriction of this problem under the additional
constraint that edges added to $G$ to reach $M(G)$ must form a walk (i.e., a
path with possibly repeated edges and vertices) of $G$. We investigate the
general consequences of having this additional constraint, and provide several
results of different natures (structural, combinatorial, algorithmic) on the
length of the shortest irregularising walks, for general graphs and more
restricted classes.

Abstract: Snake is a classic computer game, which has been around for decades. Based on
this game, we study the game of Snake on arbitrary undirected graphs. A snake
forms a simple path that has to move to an apple while avoiding colliding with
itself. When the snake reaches the apple, it grows longer, and a new apple
appears. A graph on which the snake has a strategy to keep eating apples until
it covers all the vertices of the graph is called snake-winnable. We prove that
determining whether a graph is snake-winnable is NP-hard, even when restricted
to grid graphs. We fully characterize snake-winnable graphs for odd-sized
bipartite graphs and graphs with vertex-connectivity 1. While Hamiltonian
graphs are always snake-winnable, we show that non-Hamiltonian snake-winnable
graphs have a girth of at most 6 and that this bound is tight.

### [9] [Adaptive Hybrid Sort: Dynamic Strategy Selection for Optimal Sorting Across Diverse Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20677)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自适应混合排序范式，根据输入数据的实时模式选择最有效的排序算法（Counting Sort、Radix Sort或QuickSort），显著提升了执行时间和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有排序算法无法在所有数据分布下都表现最优，因此需要一种能根据数据特征动态选择最优算法的自适应排序方案。

Method: 该方法通过特征提取模块分析数据的关键参数（如数据量、值范围和熵），并使用有限状态机和XGBoost分类器动态选择最优排序算法。

Result: 实验证明，该框架在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，执行时间、灵活性和效率优于传统静态排序算法。

Conclusion: 该自适应混合排序框架具有高度可扩展性和广泛适用性，适用于大数据分析、边缘计算等场景。

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了构建平衡k-d树的不同技术，对比了三种分区方法的性能，并提出并分析了其中一种方法的双线程执行方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于k-d树无法使用传统的平衡技术（如AVL树或红黑树），需要通过找到中位数并分区来实现平衡。不同分区方法对构建k-d树的计算复杂度有重要影响。

Method: 研究对比了三种k-d树的变体，分别采用不同的分区技术，并对比了它们的性能。此外，还提出并分析了其中一种变体的双线程执行方案。

Result: 通过对比三种分区方法，得出它们对k-d树构建复杂度的不同影响。双线程执行方案被证明对提升性能有潜力。

Conclusion: 构建k-d树的分区技术对其效率至关重要，双线程执行是一种可行的优化方向。

Abstract: The original description of the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing
techniques, such as used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not
applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to find the median of a set of data for each recursive subdivision of
that set. The sort or selection used to find the median, and the technique used
to partition the set about that median, strongly influence the computational
complexity of building a k-d tree. This article describes and contrasts three
variants of the k-d tree that differ in their technique used to partition the
set, and compares the performance of those variants. In addition, dual-threaded
execution is proposed and analyzed for one of the three variants.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Covering and partitioning the edges of a graph into cliques are classical
problems at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and graph theory,
having been studied through a range of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic
lenses. Despite the well-known fixed-parameter tractability of these problems
when parameterized by the total number of cliques, such a parameterization
often fails to be meaningful for sparse graphs. In many real-world instances,
on the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition
can be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \alpha(G).
  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \alpha parameterizations
of the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and
study Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\alpha) and Edge Clique
Partition Above Independent Set (ECP/\alpha), where the goal is to cover or
partition all edges of a graph using at most \alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is
the parameter. Our main results reveal a distinct complexity landscape for the
two variants. We show that ECP/\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas
ECC/\alpha is NP-complete for all k \geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial
time for k \in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between
the two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a
natural lower bound.
  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by k + \omega(G), where \omega(G) is the size of a maximum
clique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs,
in which \omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a
subexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}.

### [12] [A Framework for Building Data Structures from Communication Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20761)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a general framework for designing efficient data structures for
high-dimensional pattern-matching problems ($\exists \;? i\in[n], f(x_i,y)=1$)
through communication models in which $f(x,y)$ admits sublinear communication
protocols with exponentially-small error. Specifically, we reduce the data
structure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication
complexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.
  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with
wildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.
When the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of
$\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\log n \;(\ll d)$, the fastest known
linear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query
time $t \approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$. By contrast,
our framework produces a data structure with query time $n^{1-1/(c \log^2 c)}$
and space close to linear.
  To achieve this, we develop a one-sided $\epsilon$-error communication
protocol for Set-Disjointness under product distributions with
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\log(1/\epsilon)})$ complexity, improving on the
classical result of Babai, Frankl and Simon (FOCS'86). Building on this
protocol, we show that the Unambiguous AM communication complexity of
$w$-Sparse Set-Disjointness with $\epsilon$-error under product distributions
is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{w \log(1/\epsilon)})$, independent of the ambient dimension
$d$, which is crucial for the Partial Match result. Our framework sheds further
light on the power of data-dependent data structures, which is instrumental for
reducing to the (much easier) case of product distributions.

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了部分匹配问题的解决方案，还展示了依赖数据的结构在处理产品分布时的潜力，为高维模式匹配问题提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We present a general framework for designing efficient data structures for
high-dimensional pattern-matching problems ($\exists \;? i\in[n], f(x_i,y)=1$)
through communication models in which $f(x,y)$ admits sublinear communication
protocols with exponentially-small error. Specifically, we reduce the data
structure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication
complexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.
  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with
wildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.
When the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of
$\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\log n \;(\ll d)$, the fastest known
linear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query
time $t \approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$. By contrast,
our framework produces a data structure with query time $n^{1-1/(c \log^2 c)}$
and space close to linear.
  To achieve this, we develop a one-sided $\epsilon$-error communication
protocol for Set-Disjointness under product distributions with
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\log(1/\epsilon)})$ complexity, improving on the
classical result of Babai, Frankl and Simon (FOCS'86). Building on this
protocol, we show that the Unambiguous AM communication complexity of
$w$-Sparse Set-Disjointness with $\epsilon$-error under product distributions
is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{w \log(1/\epsilon)})$, independent of the ambient dimension
$d$, which is crucial for the Partial Match result. Our framework sheds further
light on the power of data-dependent data structures, which is instrumental for
reducing to the (much easier) case of product distributions.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于本地差分隐私（LDP）的新型算法，用于解决大规模网络中的隐私保护问题，特别是在k-core分解和三角形计数两个基本图统计任务中，取得了显著的精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模网络在各个领域的广泛应用，涉及敏感数据的图分析任务引发了隐私关注。传统集中式隐私模型依赖可信第三方，而本地差分隐私（LDP）在个体层面保证隐私，无需信任第三方，更适用于实际场景。

Method: 论文提出了两种基于LDP的算法：用于k-core分解和三角形计数。算法利用了图的固有特性（如退化性和最大度数）来优化理论效用，并通过私有出度定向和改进的随机响应技术，显著提升了误差边界。

Result: 实验结果表明，k-core分解的误差仅为精确值的3倍，远优于基线方法的131倍误差；三角形计数算法的近似误差降低了六个数量级，同时保持了竞争力的运行时间。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为图分析任务提供了更强的隐私保护解决方案，还在分布式模拟中验证了算法的实用性，为未来的隐私保护图分析研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates
sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising
privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local
differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level,
where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a
trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph
statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages
input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and
maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior
methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the
total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For
triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and
Chaudhury~\cite{IMC21locally, IMC21communication}, which bounds error in terms
of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy
by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et
al.'s randomized response technique~\cite{ELRS23, and a novel analysis,
yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are
the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike
prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show
substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x
of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala
et al.~\cite{DLRSSY22}. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative
approximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining
competitive runtime.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对k-edge connected spanning subgraph（kECSS）问题的近似算法，对于偶数k和奇数k分别获得接近最优的解，并在边成本和质量上显著优于前人工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究kECSS问题的动机在于其在实际应用中的重要性，如图网络设计和优化问题。kECSS问题在k≥2时是APX难的，因此需要高效的近似算法来提供接近最优的解。

Method: 本文使用线性规划松弛（LP-relaxation）的方法，对于偶数k设计了一个多项式时间算法，获得一个(k-2)-edge connected子图；对于奇数k，获得一个(k-3)-edge connected子图。同时，还提供了基于单位边成本的改进算法。

Result: 算法结果在边连通性和成本上接近最优，对于偶数k和奇数k分别提供(k-2)和(k-3)的连通性保证。此外，对于kECSM问题，也提供了近似比为(1+2/k)和(1+3/k)的算法。

Conclusion: 本文方法不仅提高了kECSS和kECSM问题的近似比和连通性保证，还扩展到带度数约束的版本，为相关问题的研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We consider the \emph{$k$-edge connected spanning subgraph} (kECSS) problem,
where we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with nonnegative edge costs
$\{c_e\}_{e\in E}$, and we seek a minimum-cost \emph{$k$-edge connected}
subgraph $H$ of $G$. For even $k$, we present a polytime algorithm that
computes a $(k-2)$-edge connected subgraph of cost at most the optimal value
$LP^*$ of the natural LP-relaxation for kECSS; for odd $k$, we obtain a
$(k-3)$-edge connected subgraph of cost at most $LP^*$. Since kECSS is APX-hard
for all $k\geq 2$, our results are nearly optimal. They also significantly
improve upon the recent work of Hershkowitz et al., both in terms of solution
quality and the simplicity of algorithm and its analysis. Our techniques also
yield an alternate guarantee, where we obtain a $(k-1)$-edge connected subgraph
of cost at most $1.5\cdot LP^*$; with unit edge costs, the cost guarantee
improves to $(1+\frac{4}{3k})\cdot LP^*$, which improves upon the
state-of-the-art approximation for unit edge costs, but with a unit loss in
edge connectivity.
  Our kECSS-result also yields results for the \emph{$k$-edge connected
spanning multigraph} (kECSM) problem, where multiple copies of an edge can be
selected: we obtain a $(1+2/k)$-approximation algorithm for even $k$, and a
$(1+3/k)$-approximation algorithm for odd $k$.
  Our techniques extend to the degree-bounded versions of kECSS and kECSM,
wherein we also impose degree lower- and upper- bounds on the nodes. We obtain
the same cost and connectivity guarantees for these degree-bounded versions
with an additive violation of (roughly) $2$ for the degree bounds. These are
the first results for degree-bounded \{kECSS,kECSM\} of the form where the cost
of the solution obtained is at most the optimum, and the connectivity
constraints are violated by an additive constant.

Motivation: 现有的Lipschitz连续算法针对特定问题设计，缺乏通用性。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了一个通用的算法元定理，为有界树宽图上的问题提供稳定的Lipschitz连续算法。

Method: 论文扩展了Courcelle定理的思路，提出了一个Lipschitz连续算法的元定理，用于在有界树宽图上解决基于MSO_2逻辑约束的优化问题，并提供多项式对数级的Lipschitz常数近似算法。

Result: 论文展示了对于任何ε>0，存在一个(1±ε)-近似算法，其Lipschitz常数在对数多项式级别，且性能优于大多数现有算法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的元定理为Lipschitz连续算法领域提供了通用解决方案，并在有界树宽图和有界团宽图上取得了高效且稳定的结果。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity of algorithms, introduced by Kumabe and Yoshida
(FOCS'23), measures the stability of an algorithm against small input
perturbations. Algorithms with small Lipschitz continuity are desirable, as
they ensure reliable decision-making and reproducible scientific research.
Several studies have proposed Lipschitz continuous algorithms for various
combinatorial optimization problems, but these algorithms are problem-specific,
requiring a separate design for each problem.
  To address this issue, we provide the first algorithmic meta-theorem in the
field of Lipschitz continuous algorithms. Our result can be seen as a Lipschitz
continuous analogue of Courcelle's theorem, which offers Lipschitz continuous
algorithms for problems on bounded-treewidth graphs. Specifically, we consider
the problem of finding a vertex set in a graph that maximizes or minimizes the
total weight, subject to constraints expressed in monadic second-order logic
(MSO_2). We show that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $(1\pm
\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with a polylogarithmic
Lipschitz constant on bounded treewidth graphs. On such graphs, our result
outperforms most existing Lipschitz continuous algorithms in terms of
approximability and/or Lipschitz continuity. Further, we provide similar
results for problems on bounded-clique-width graphs subject to constraints
expressed in MSO_1. Additionally, we construct a Lipschitz continuous version
of Baker's decomposition using our meta-theorem as a subroutine.

Motivation: 堆叠面积图是一种广泛使用的时间序列可视化技术，但优化其可读性的边界摆动（wiggle）的计算复杂性尚未被正式分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 论文分析了不同变体的wiggle最小化问题的计算复杂性，提出了一个精确的混合整数线性规划方法，并与当前最优启发式算法进行了实验比较。

Result: 结果显示wiggle最小化问题是NP难的且难以近似。混合整数线性规划方法的性能得到了验证，并且在特殊情况下与排序问题相关联。

Conclusion: 本文证明了wiggle最小化问题的计算复杂性，为堆叠面积图的优化提供了理论和实践基础。同时还揭示了其与排序问题的联系。

Abstract: Stacked area charts are a widely used visualization technique for numerical
time series. The x-axis represents time, and the time series are displayed as
horizontal, variable-height layers stacked on top of each other. The height of
each layer corresponds to the time series values at each time point. The main
aesthetic criterion for optimizing the readability of stacked area charts is
the amount of vertical change of the borders between the time series in the
visualization, called wiggle. While many heuristic algorithms have been
developed to minimize wiggle, the computational complexity of minimizing wiggle
has not been formally analyzed. In this paper, we show that different variants
of wiggle minimization are NP-hard and even hard to approximate. We also
present an exact mixed-integer linear programming formulation and compare its
performance with a state-of-the-art heuristic in an experimental evaluation.
Lastly, we consider a special case of wiggle minimization that corresponds to
the fundamentally interesting and natural problem of ordering a set of numbers
as to minimize their sum of absolute prefix sums. We show several complexity
results for this problem that imply some of the mentioned hardness results for
wiggle minimization.

Conclusion: 该研究为互联网瓶颈容量估计提供了有效的观测点选择方法，并在不同模型中验证了算法的性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of estimating bottleneck capacities on the Internet,
we formulate and study the problem of vantage point selection. We are given a
graph $G=(V, E)$ whose edges $E$ have unknown capacity values that are to be
discovered. Probes from a vantage point, i.e, a vertex $v \in V$, along
shortest paths from $v$ to all other vertices, reveal bottleneck edge
capacities along each path. Our goal is to select $k$ vantage points from $V$
that reveal the maximum number of bottleneck edge capacities.
  We consider both a non-adaptive setting where all $k$ vantage points are
selected before any bottleneck capacity is revealed, and an adaptive setting
where each vantage point selection instantly reveals bottleneck capacities
along all shortest paths starting from that point. In the non-adaptive setting,
by considering a relaxed model where edge capacities are drawn from a random
permutation (which still leaves the problem of maximizing the expected number
of revealed edges NP-hard), we are able to give a $1-1/e$ approximate
algorithm. In the adaptive setting we work with the least permissive model
where edge capacities are arbitrarily fixed but unknown. We compare with the
best solution for the particular input instance (i.e. by enumerating all
choices of $k$ tuples), and provide both lower bounds on instance optimal
approximation algorithms and upper bounds for trees and planar graphs.

Motivation: 研究动机在于填补图数据压缩领域的空白，当前大多数方法针对特定类别的图，缺乏通用且高效的压缩数据结构。

Method: 方法是通过设计一种数据结构，其空间使用随图的压缩性自动优化，并支持高效的导航操作，特别针对Barabási-Albert模型的图。

Result: 结果表明，该数据结构在Barabási-Albert模型下接近实例最优空间，同时对任意图保证空间不超压缩边列表。

Conclusion: 结论是该数据结构在通用性和效率上优于现有方法，为压缩图数据的计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computing over compressed data combines the space saving of data compression
with efficient support for queries directly on the compressed representation.
Such data structures are widely applied in text indexing and have been
successfully generalised to trees. For graphs, support for computing over
compressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data
structures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same,
worst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.
  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically
improves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently
supporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access).
Specifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal
space when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\'asi-Albert model
of preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for
arbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an
entropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful
analysis of the instance-optimal space usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的排序算法在不同数据分布下并非总是最优，因此需要一个自适应框架来动态选择最适合的排序方法以提高性能。

Method: 该框架通过特征提取模块计算数据的关键参数（如数据量、值范围和熵），并利用有限状态机和XGBoost分类器选择最优排序策略。具体情况下，计数排序用于小范围键值，基数排序用于大范围低熵键值，快速排序用于通用排序。

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应排序框架具有高度可扩展性和广泛的适用性，适用于大数据分析、边缘计算和硬件受限系统等多种数据处理场景。

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

Motivation: 由于传统的平衡技术（如AVL树或红黑树）不适用于k-d树，构建平衡k-d树需要为每次递归分区找到数据集的中位数。研究旨在对比不同分区技术对构建k-d树的计算复杂度的影响。

Method: 论文提出了三种k-d树的变体，它们的分区技术不同，并分析了这些变体的性能差异。此外，还对其中一种变体提出了双线程执行方案并进行分析。

Result: 研究比较了三种k-d树变体的性能，展示了不同分区技术对计算复杂度的影响。双线程执行方案被证明在特定情况下能提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文总结了不同分区技术对k-d树构建效率的影响，并验证了双线程执行在优化性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The original description of the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing
techniques, such as used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not
applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to find the median of a set of data for each recursive subdivision of
that set. The sort or selection used to find the median, and the technique used
to partition the set about that median, strongly influence the computational
complexity of building a k-d tree. This article describes and contrasts three
variants of the k-d tree that differ in their technique used to partition the
set, and compares the performance of those variants. In addition, dual-threaded
execution is proposed and analyzed for one of the three variants.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了边团覆盖和分区问题在参数化上的复杂差异，并提出针对稀疏图的高效算法。

Abstract: Covering and partitioning the edges of a graph into cliques are classical
problems at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and graph theory,
having been studied through a range of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic
lenses. Despite the well-known fixed-parameter tractability of these problems
when parameterized by the total number of cliques, such a parameterization
often fails to be meaningful for sparse graphs. In many real-world instances,
on the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition
can be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \alpha(G).
  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \alpha parameterizations
of the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and
study Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\alpha) and Edge Clique
Partition Above Independent Set (ECP/\alpha), where the goal is to cover or
partition all edges of a graph using at most \alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is
the parameter. Our main results reveal a distinct complexity landscape for the
two variants. We show that ECP/\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas
ECC/\alpha is NP-complete for all k \geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial
time for k \in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between
the two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a
natural lower bound.
  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by k + \omega(G), where \omega(G) is the size of a maximum
clique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs,
in which \omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a
subexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}.

for all $k\geq 2$, our results are nearly optimal. They also significantly
improve upon the recent work of Hershkowitz et al., both in terms of solution

yield an alternate guarantee, where we obtain a $(k-1)$-edge connected subgraph
of cost at most $1.5\cdot LP^*$; with unit edge costs, the cost guarantee
improves to $(1+\frac{4}{3k})\cdot LP^*$, which improves upon the

edge connectivity.

of the solution obtained is at most the optimum, and the connectivity
constraints are violated by an additive constant.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity of algorithms, introduced by Kumabe and Yoshida
(FOCS'23), measures the stability of an algorithm against small input
perturbations. Algorithms with small Lipschitz continuity are desirable, as
they ensure reliable decision-making and reproducible scientific research.
Several studies have proposed Lipschitz continuous algorithms for various
combinatorial optimization problems, but these algorithms are problem-specific,
requiring a separate design for each problem.
  To address this issue, we provide the first algorithmic meta-theorem in the
field of Lipschitz continuous algorithms. Our result can be seen as a Lipschitz
continuous analogue of Courcelle's theorem, which offers Lipschitz continuous
algorithms for problems on bounded-treewidth graphs. Specifically, we consider
the problem of finding a vertex set in a graph that maximizes or minimizes the
total weight, subject to constraints expressed in monadic second-order logic
(MSO_2). We show that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $(1\pm
\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with a polylogarithmic
Lipschitz constant on bounded treewidth graphs. On such graphs, our result
outperforms most existing Lipschitz continuous algorithms in terms of
approximability and/or Lipschitz continuity. Further, we provide similar
results for problems on bounded-clique-width graphs subject to constraints
expressed in MSO_1. Additionally, we construct a Lipschitz continuous version
of Baker's decomposition using our meta-theorem as a subroutine.

Abstract: Stacked area charts are a widely used visualization technique for numerical
time series. The x-axis represents time, and the time series are displayed as
horizontal, variable-height layers stacked on top of each other. The height of
each layer corresponds to the time series values at each time point. The main
aesthetic criterion for optimizing the readability of stacked area charts is
the amount of vertical change of the borders between the time series in the
visualization, called wiggle. While many heuristic algorithms have been
developed to minimize wiggle, the computational complexity of minimizing wiggle
has not been formally analyzed. In this paper, we show that different variants
of wiggle minimization are NP-hard and even hard to approximate. We also
present an exact mixed-integer linear programming formulation and compare its
performance with a state-of-the-art heuristic in an experimental evaluation.
Lastly, we consider a special case of wiggle minimization that corresponds to
the fundamentally interesting and natural problem of ordering a set of numbers
as to minimize their sum of absolute prefix sums. We show several complexity
results for this problem that imply some of the mentioned hardness results for
wiggle minimization.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of estimating bottleneck capacities on the Internet,
we formulate and study the problem of vantage point selection. We are given a
graph $G=(V, E)$ whose edges $E$ have unknown capacity values that are to be
discovered. Probes from a vantage point, i.e, a vertex $v \in V$, along
shortest paths from $v$ to all other vertices, reveal bottleneck edge
capacities along each path. Our goal is to select $k$ vantage points from $V$
that reveal the maximum number of bottleneck edge capacities.
  We consider both a non-adaptive setting where all $k$ vantage points are
selected before any bottleneck capacity is revealed, and an adaptive setting
where each vantage point selection instantly reveals bottleneck capacities
along all shortest paths starting from that point. In the non-adaptive setting,
by considering a relaxed model where edge capacities are drawn from a random
permutation (which still leaves the problem of maximizing the expected number
of revealed edges NP-hard), we are able to give a $1-1/e$ approximate
algorithm. In the adaptive setting we work with the least permissive model
where edge capacities are arbitrarily fixed but unknown. We compare with the
best solution for the particular input instance (i.e. by enumerating all
choices of $k$ tuples), and provide both lower bounds on instance optimal
approximation algorithms and upper bounds for trees and planar graphs.

Conclusion: 本文证明了通过分析实例最优空间利用率，可以设计出适用于压缩图的高效数据结构，支持广泛的导航操作。

Abstract: Computing over compressed data combines the space saving of data compression
with efficient support for queries directly on the compressed representation.
Such data structures are widely applied in text indexing and have been
successfully generalised to trees. For graphs, support for computing over
compressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data
structures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same,
worst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.
  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically
improves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently
supporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access).
Specifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal
space when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\'asi-Albert model
of preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for
arbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an
entropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful
analysis of the instance-optimal space usage.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应混合排序框架具有可扩展性和广泛应用性，适用于大数据分析、边缘计算和硬件受限系统等多种数据处理场景。

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

Motivation: 传统k-d树无法使用AVL树或红黑树的再平衡技术，因此需要找到数据的中间值来实现递归平衡。构建方法的计算复杂度取决于中间值的查找和分区技术，因此需要对比不同方法的性能。

Method: 描述了三种k-d树的变体，每种变体采用不同的分区技术。并针对其中一种变体，提出并分析了双线程执行的性能。

Result: 对比了三种分区技术对k-d树构建的性能影响，并展示了双线程执行对其中一种变体的优化效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，分区技术的选择显著影响k-d树的构建性能，双线程执行可以进一步优化特定变体的效率。

Abstract: The original description of the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing
techniques, such as used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not
applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to find the median of a set of data for each recursive subdivision of
that set. The sort or selection used to find the median, and the technique used
to partition the set about that median, strongly influence the computational
complexity of building a k-d tree. This article describes and contrasts three
variants of the k-d tree that differ in their technique used to partition the
set, and compares the performance of those variants. In addition, dual-threaded
execution is proposed and analyzed for one of the three variants.

Motivation: 尽管边团覆盖和分割问题在参数化为团总数时是固定参数易处理的，但对于稀疏图，这种参数化方法往往不适用。论文通过观察最小团数与最大独立集大小的关系，提出了一种新的参数化方法。

Method: 论文研究了“边团覆盖超过独立集”（ECC/α）和“边团分割超过独立集”（ECP/α）问题，通过参数化方法分析其复杂度。

Result: 结果显示，ECP/α是固定参数易处理的，而ECC/α在k≥2时为NP完全问题，但在k∈{0,1}时可在多项式时间内解决。此外，当参数化为k+ω(G)时，ECC/α也成为固定参数易处理问题。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了边团覆盖和分割问题在参数化方法上的显著差异，并为稀疏图提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Covering and partitioning the edges of a graph into cliques are classical
problems at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and graph theory,
having been studied through a range of algorithmic and complexity-theoretic
lenses. Despite the well-known fixed-parameter tractability of these problems
when parameterized by the total number of cliques, such a parameterization
often fails to be meaningful for sparse graphs. In many real-world instances,
on the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition
can be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \alpha(G).
  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \alpha parameterizations
of the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and
study Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\alpha) and Edge Clique
Partition Above Independent Set (ECP/\alpha), where the goal is to cover or
partition all edges of a graph using at most \alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is
the parameter. Our main results reveal a distinct complexity landscape for the
two variants. We show that ECP/\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas
ECC/\alpha is NP-complete for all k \geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial
time for k \in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between
the two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a
natural lower bound.
  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by k + \omega(G), where \omega(G) is the size of a maximum
clique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs,
in which \omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a
subexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}.

Motivation: 当前的线性空间数据结构在处理高维模式匹配问题时查询时间较长，尤其在部分匹配问题中表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过通信模型将数据结构问题转化为UAM通信复杂度问题，并开发了一种新的单侧ε错误通信协议，改进了Set-Disjointness问题的经典结果。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了数据依赖数据结构在处理复杂问题时的强大能力，并为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a general framework for designing efficient data structures for
high-dimensional pattern-matching problems ($\exists \;? i\in[n], f(x_i,y)=1$)
through communication models in which $f(x,y)$ admits sublinear communication
protocols with exponentially-small error. Specifically, we reduce the data
structure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication
complexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.
  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with
wildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.
When the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of
$\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\log n \;(\ll d)$, the fastest known
linear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query
time $t \approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$. By contrast,
our framework produces a data structure with query time $n^{1-1/(c \log^2 c)}$
and space close to linear.
  To achieve this, we develop a one-sided $\epsilon$-error communication
protocol for Set-Disjointness under product distributions with
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\log(1/\epsilon)})$ complexity, improving on the
classical result of Babai, Frankl and Simon (FOCS'86). Building on this
protocol, we show that the Unambiguous AM communication complexity of
$w$-Sparse Set-Disjointness with $\epsilon$-error under product distributions
is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{w \log(1/\epsilon)})$, independent of the ambient dimension
$d$, which is crucial for the Partial Match result. Our framework sheds further
light on the power of data-dependent data structures, which is instrumental for
reducing to the (much easier) case of product distributions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates
sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising
privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local
differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level,
where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a
trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph
statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages
input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and
maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior
methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the
total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For
triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and
Chaudhury~\cite{IMC21locally, IMC21communication}, which bounds error in terms
of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy
by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et
al.'s randomized response technique~\cite{ELRS23, and a novel analysis,
yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are
the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike
prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show
substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x
of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala
et al.~\cite{DLRSSY22}. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative
approximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining
competitive runtime.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of estimating bottleneck capacities on the Internet,
we formulate and study the problem of vantage point selection. We are given a
graph $G=(V, E)$ whose edges $E$ have unknown capacity values that are to be
discovered. Probes from a vantage point, i.e, a vertex $v \in V$, along
shortest paths from $v$ to all other vertices, reveal bottleneck edge
capacities along each path. Our goal is to select $k$ vantage points from $V$
that reveal the maximum number of bottleneck edge capacities.
  We consider both a non-adaptive setting where all $k$ vantage points are
selected before any bottleneck capacity is revealed, and an adaptive setting
where each vantage point selection instantly reveals bottleneck capacities
along all shortest paths starting from that point. In the non-adaptive setting,
by considering a relaxed model where edge capacities are drawn from a random
permutation (which still leaves the problem of maximizing the expected number
of revealed edges NP-hard), we are able to give a $1-1/e$ approximate
algorithm. In the adaptive setting we work with the least permissive model
where edge capacities are arbitrarily fixed but unknown. We compare with the
best solution for the particular input instance (i.e. by enumerating all
choices of $k$ tuples), and provide both lower bounds on instance optimal
approximation algorithms and upper bounds for trees and planar graphs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的数据结构不仅在图压缩领域实现了动态空间优化，还广泛适用于多种图类，为高效图查询提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computing over compressed data combines the space saving of data compression
with efficient support for queries directly on the compressed representation.
Such data structures are widely applied in text indexing and have been
successfully generalised to trees. For graphs, support for computing over
compressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data
structures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same,
worst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.
  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically
improves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently
supporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access).
Specifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal
space when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\'asi-Albert model
of preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for
arbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an
entropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful
analysis of the instance-optimal space usage.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed

TL;DR: FairyGen是一个自动化系统，能够从单张儿童绘画中生成故事驱动的卡通视频，并保留其独特的艺术风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的讲故事方法主要关注角色一致性和基本动作，而FairyGen希望通过解耦角色建模与风格化背景生成，并融入电影镜头设计，以实现更具表现力和连贯性的故事讲述。

Method: FairyGen使用MLLM生成结构化的故事板，引入风格传播适配器确保视觉一致性，并通过镜头设计模块增强视觉多样性和电影质量。使用3D代理角色生成物理可信的动作序列，并通过MMDiT为基础的图像到视频扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 实验表明，FairyGen生成的动画在风格上忠实于输入绘画，动作自然且叙事连贯。

Conclusion: FairyGen展示了在个性化和引人入胜的故事动画方面的潜力，并为自动生成高质量卡通视频提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

TL;DR: IDGraphs是一个用于入侵检测的交互式可视化系统，能够有效检测和分析网络中的异常和攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有入侵检测系统在检测异常和攻击方面存在局限性，无法满足高速网络流量增长的需求，因此需要更高效和交互式的解决方案。

Method: IDGraphs通过时间轴水平排列和垂直排列的不成功连接数绘制流级轨迹，并使用Histographs技术汇总大量轨迹，实现了交互式查询与分析。

Result: 该系统成功应用于包含1.79亿条流记录的真实网络数据集，检测到了端口扫描、蠕虫爆发、隐蔽TCP SYN洪泛等多种攻击和异常。

Conclusion: IDGraphs提供了一个可扩展且交互式的解决方案，能够帮助网络运营商快速准确地识别和分析复杂的网络攻击。

Abstract: Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and
identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network
operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to
detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However,
existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining
detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3)
and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute
as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow.
  IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that
addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a
flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number
of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of
tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs [RW05]
technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may
then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting
subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view
highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are
difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis.
  We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M
flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system
successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including
port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed
attacks.

Result: 实验表明，VideoTex在纹理逼真度、接缝融合和时间稳定性方面优于现有方法，能够生成高质量且时间稳定的纹理。

Conclusion: VideoTex通过结合视频生成模型和几何感知技术，为动态实时应用提供了视觉质量和时间一致性兼具的纹理合成解决方案。

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

### [57] [FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272)
*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen是一个从儿童单一绘画自动生成故事驱动卡通视频的系统，忠实保留了其独特的艺术风格，并通过解耦角色建模与风格化背景生成，结合电影镜头设计来实现表达性和连贯性叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的叙事方法主要关注角色一致性和基本动作，无法充分保留绘画风格并支持高质量的叙事表达。FairyGen旨在填补这一空白，通过自动化和个性化方式生成风格一致的生动视频。

Method: 系统利用MLLM生成结构化故事板，引入风格传播适配器确保视觉一致性，并通过镜头设计模块增强视觉多样性。角色动画通过3D代理和MMDiT模型实现，运动定制适配器分两阶段解耦外观与动作。

Result: 实验证明FairyGen能生成风格忠实、叙事结构合理且动作自然的视频，展现了其在个性化故事动画中的潜力。

Conclusion: FairyGen通过解耦角色与背景生成、结合电影镜头设计和创新的运动定制技术，成功实现了从儿童绘画到高质量叙事视频的自动化生成。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: IDGraphs是一种交互式可视化系统，用于解决现有入侵检测系统在交互式检查、蠕虫传播模式分析和关联攻击发现方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有入侵检测系统（IDS）在交互式检查、蠕虫传播模式分析和关联攻击发现方面支持有限，且随着高速路由器流量增长，这些问题变得更加严重。

Method: IDGraphs通过绘制时间与不成功连接数的流动级追踪图，并使用Histographs技术汇总大量追踪数据，用户可交互查询摘要视图，通过高亮子集进行分析。

Result: 在包含1.79亿条流动级记录的真实网络路由器数据集上，IDGraphs成功检测并分析了多种攻击和异常，包括端口扫描、蠕虫爆发、隐蔽TCP SYN洪水攻击和一些分布式攻击。

Conclusion: IDGraphs系统有效解决了现有IDS系统的局限性，提供了一种高效的交互式可视化方法，用于检测和分析网络中的攻击和异常。

Abstract: Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and
identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network
operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to
detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However,
existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining
detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3)
and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute
as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow.
  IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that
addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a
flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number
of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of
tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs [RW05]
technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may
then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting
subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view
highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are
difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis.
  We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M
flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system
successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including
port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed
attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成块的3D场景编辑方法，通过操纵简单的几何抽象来生成和编辑图像，提高了视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景编辑中难以同时保持纹理一致性和编辑灵活性，因此需要一种新的方法来平衡这两者。

Method: 使用凸3D基元表示场景，并通过基于流的方法生成图像，该方法考虑了深度和纹理提示，优于现有的键值缓存技术。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Generative Blocks World通过结合3D基元表示和纹理提示，实现了高性能的3D场景编辑和图像生成。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将头发和面部的建模混为一谈，限制了模型的灵活性和编辑能力。3DGH旨在通过分离头发和面部的建模，提高生成模型的可编辑性和合成质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于模板的3D高斯溅射表示方法，引入了可变形头发几何体来捕捉不同发型的几何变化。设计了一个基于3D GAN的双生成器架构，并采用交叉注意力机制来建模头发和面部的相关性。使用合成渲染数据进行训练，并通过精心设计的目标函数稳定训练。

Conclusion: 3DGH通过分离头发和面部的建模，实现了高质量且可编辑的3D人头生成。未来工作将在项目页面提供更多细节。

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

only half of US adults are considered financially literate. Data visualization
simplifies these concepts, making them accessible and engaging for learners of
all ages. This systematic review analyzes 37 research papers exploring the use
of data visualization and visual analytics in financial education and literacy
enhancement. We classify these studies into five key areas: (1) the evolution
of visualization use across time and space, (2) motivations for using
visualization tools, (3) the financial topics addressed and instructional
approaches used, (4) the types of tools and technologies applied, and (5) how
the effectiveness of teaching interventions was evaluated. Furthermore, we
identify research gaps and highlight opportunities for advancing financial
literacy. Our findings offer practical insights for educators and professionals
to effectively utilize or design visual tools for financial literacy.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了平滑框架以适应自动竞价，提出了平衡异质代理类型平滑参数的技术，证明了单物品第一价格拍卖的平滑性，并展示了其在多种模型中的适用性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线广告系统向自动竞价过渡，研究不同拍卖形式下的价格无政府状态（POA）变得尤为重要。本文旨在扩展平滑框架以更好地分析自动竞价中的异质代理行为。

Method: 扩展了Syrgkanis和Tardos的平滑框架，提出了平衡异质代理类型平滑参数的技术，并通过数学程序揭示了最佳的POA界限。证明了单物品第一价格拍卖的平滑性，并展示了其在多种模型中的适用性。

Result: 通过该方法，成功证明了混合自动竞价中紧致的POA界限（如2.18），并在超越现有技术的模型中建立了首个（大多）紧致的POA界限。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅简化了自动竞价中POA的分析，还扩展了其适用范围，并能处理粗粒度相关均衡（CCE），为自动竞价的理论研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding,
enabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each
advertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective
subject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their
relevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare
price of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which
simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of
heterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA
bounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for
mixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for
additive valuations.
  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to
autobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters
across heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving
a POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)
Simplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous
FPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and
utility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)
Extendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve
prices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous
payment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first
(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of
the art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated
equilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing
algorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from
such agents have properties that keep their POA low.

Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$

in the value that each agent receives. One consequence of this result is that
for allocation instances with equal entitlements and subadditive valuations, if
$\rho$-MMS $d$-multi-allocations exist, then so do $\frac{\rho}{4d}$-MMS
allocations. Combined with recent results of Seddighin and Seddighin [EC 2025],
this implies the existence of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$-MMS allocations.

relevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare
price of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which
simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of
heterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA
bounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for
mixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for
additive valuations.
  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to
autobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters
across heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving
a POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)
Simplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous
FPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and
utility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)
Extendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve
prices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous
payment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first
(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of
the art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated

TL;DR: 通过研究不可分割物品的公平分配问题，证明了在单调次可加估值下，d-多重分配可以转化为分配，且损失不超过d倍的代理价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不可分割物品在多代理间的公平分配问题，特别是在单调次可加估值下，如何通过d-多重分配实现近似公平。

Method: 将d-多重分配转化为单一分配，并分析代理价值损失的因子。

Result: 证明了如果存在ρ-MMS的d-多重分配，则存在ρ/(4d)-MMS的单一分配。结合已有研究，该结果进一步证明了Ω(1/loglogn)-MMS分配的存在性。

Conclusion: 该研究为公平分配问题提供了新的理论支持，特别是在d-多重分配与单一分配之间的转换及其近似公平性上具有重要贡献。

Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$
agents with monotone subadditive valuations. For integer $d \ge 2$, a
$d$-multi-allocation is an allocation in which each item is allocated to at
most $d$ different agents. We show that $d$-multi-allocations can be
transformed into allocations, while not losing much more than a factor of $d$
in the value that each agent receives. One consequence of this result is that
for allocation instances with equal entitlements and subadditive valuations, if
$\rho$-MMS $d$-multi-allocations exist, then so do $\frac{\rho}{4d}$-MMS
allocations. Combined with recent results of Seddighin and Seddighin [EC 2025],
this implies the existence of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$-MMS allocations.

Motivation: 在线广告系统转向自动竞价后，广告商通过自动化代理优化目标。现有文献研究了核心拍卖形式的价格无政府状态，但缺乏对异质代理行为的统一分析框架。

Method: 扩展了Syrgkanis和Tardos的平滑性框架，提出一种平衡异质代理类型参数的技术，并通过数学程序揭示最佳POA界限。

Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding,
enabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each
advertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective

Abstract: Analyzing refutations of the well known 0pebbling formulas Peb$(G)$ we prove
some new strong connections between pebble games and algebraic proof system,
showing that there is a parallelism between the reversible, black and
black-white pebbling games on one side, and the three algebraic proof systems
Nullstellensatz, Monomial Calculus and Polynomial Calculus on the other side.
In particular we prove that for any DAG $G$ with a single sink, if there is a
Monomial Calculus refutation for Peb$(G)$ having simultaneously degree $s$ and
size $t$ then there is a black pebbling strategy on $G$ with space $s$ and time
$t+s$. Also if there is a black pebbling strategy for $G$ with space $s$ and
time $t$ it is possible to extract from it a MC refutation for Peb$(G)$ having
simultaneously degree $s$ and size $ts$. These results are analogous to those
proven in {deRezende et al.21} for the case of reversible pebbling and
Nullstellensatz. Using them we prove degree separations between NS, MC and PC,
as well as strong degree-size tradeoffs for MC.
  We also notice that for any directed acyclic graph $G$ the space needed in a
pebbling strategy on $G$, for the three versions of the game, reversible, black
and black-white, exactly matches the variable space complexity of a refutation
of the corresponding pebbling formula Peb$(G)$ in each of the algebraic proof
systems NS, MC and PC. Using known pebbling bounds on graphs, this connection
implies separations between the corresponding variable space measures.

Abstract: We study the problem of deciding whether a point escapes a closed subset of

decision method for this problem which is complete in the sense that its
halting set contains the halting set of all sound partial decision methods for
the problem. Equivalently, our decision method terminates on all problem
instances whose answer is robust under all sufficiently small perturbations of
the function. We further show that the halting set of our algorithm is dense in
the set of all problem instances. While our algorithm applies to general
continuous functions, we demonstrate that it also yields complete decision
methods for much more rigid function families: affine linear systems and
quadratic complex polynomials. In the latter case, completeness is subject to
the density of hyperbolicity conjecture in complex dynamics. This in particular
yields an alternative proof of Hertling's (2004) conditional answer to a

applying the homomorphic properties. On such sequences, various Zero Knowledge

pre-locally tabular logics in normal extensions of products of finite height,
and that every non-locally tabular logic in this family is contained in one of
them. We also give an axiomatic criterion of local tabularity above the logic
of products with Noetherian skeletons. Then we construct examples of
pre-locally tabular extensions of $\mathrm{S4}\times \mathrm{S4}$ outside this
class. In particular, we describe pre-locally tabular bimodal logics with the
converse and universal modalities.

Abstract: We investigate several relations between cardinal characteristics of the

\textsf{all}}=\mathfrak{dd}_{\{1/2\}, \textsf{all}}$ for all $r\in (0,1)$, and

Abstract: The concept of Galois connections (i.e., adjoint pairs between posets) is
ubiquitous in mathematics. In representation theory, it is interesting because
it naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of
persistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of
central subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to
understand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a
class of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a
full subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its
corresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint
quadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the
contraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction
functor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an
adjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we
introduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems,
and prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve
interval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval
covers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions
for certain classes of finite posets.

Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the
outer automorphism groups of the finite groups belonging to a family
$\mathscr{U}$. These arise in classical representation theory, in the study of
representation stability, as well as in global homotopy theory. In this paper
we begin a systematic study of the derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U};k)$
of global representations over fields $k$ of characteristic zero, from the
point-of-view of tensor-triangular geometry. We calculate its Balmer spectrum
for various infinite families of finite groups including elementary abelian
$p$-groups, cyclic groups, and finite abelian $p$-groups of bounded rank. We
then deduce that the Balmer spectrum associated to the family of finite abelian
$p$-groups has infinite Krull dimension and infinite Cantor--Bendixson rank,
illustrating the complex phenomena we encounter. As a concrete application, we
provide a complete tt-theoretic classification of finitely generated derived
VI-modules. Our proofs rely on subtle information about the growth behaviour of
global representations studied in a companion paper, as well as novel methods
from non-rigid tt-geometry.

Motivation: 在表示理论中，Galois连接通过Kan扩展自然诱导了持久性模块类之间的伴随四重结构。为了理解多参数持久同调分析中持久性模块的结构，本文重点研究了一类Galois连接。

Method: 研究了一类Galois连接，其左伴随是全子偏序集的规范包含，并引入内系统和对齐内系统。通过构造收缩函子和诱导函子，证明了这些函子在特定条件下保持模块的区间可分解性。

Result: 证明了诱导函子和收缩函子在有有限表示的持久性模块中形成伴随对，并且对齐内系统下的这些函子保持区间可分解性。此外，计算了某些有限偏序集的区间分辨率全局维度。

Conclusion: 通过内系统和对齐内系统的引入，本文为多参数持久同调分析中的区间覆盖和分辨率提供了一种新的分析方法，并证明了相关函子的性质。

Abstract: The concept of Galois connections (i.e., adjoint pairs between posets) is
ubiquitous in mathematics. In representation theory, it is interesting because
it naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of
persistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of
central subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to
understand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a
class of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a
full subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its
corresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint
quadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the
contraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction
functor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an
adjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we
introduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems,
and prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve
interval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval
covers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions
for certain classes of finite posets.

Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the
outer automorphism groups of the finite groups belonging to a family
$\mathscr{U}$. These arise in classical representation theory, in the study of
representation stability, as well as in global homotopy theory. In this paper
we begin a systematic study of the derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U};k)$
of global representations over fields $k$ of characteristic zero, from the
point-of-view of tensor-triangular geometry. We calculate its Balmer spectrum
for various infinite families of finite groups including elementary abelian
$p$-groups, cyclic groups, and finite abelian $p$-groups of bounded rank. We
then deduce that the Balmer spectrum associated to the family of finite abelian
$p$-groups has infinite Krull dimension and infinite Cantor--Bendixson rank,
illustrating the complex phenomena we encounter. As a concrete application, we
provide a complete tt-theoretic classification of finitely generated derived
VI-modules. Our proofs rely on subtle information about the growth behaviour of
global representations studied in a companion paper, as well as novel methods
from non-rigid tt-geometry.
