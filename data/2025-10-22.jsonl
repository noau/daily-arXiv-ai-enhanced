Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,\nsometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves\nnearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent\nfeatures through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We\ndemonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse\nindoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding\ntrained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks\nwith limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for\nspatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how\nthe normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach\nhighlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines\nwithout explicit ray-traced illumination cues."}

The problem becomes especially challenging when\ninvolving massive data, demanding mechanisms such as data aggregation and\ninteractive filtering to make the exploratory process doable. However, data\naggregation tends to smooth out certain patterns, and deciding which data\nshould be filtered is not straightforward. In this work, we propose ORDENA, a\nvisual analytic tool to explore origin and destination data. ORDENA is built\nupon a simple and intuitive scatter plot where the horizontal and vertical axes\ncorrespond to origins and destinations. Therefore, each origin-destination flow\nis represented as a point in the scatter plot. How the points are organized in\nthe plot layout reveals important spatial phenomena present in the data.\nMoreover, ORDENA provides explainability resources that allow users to better\nunderstand the relation between origin-destination flows and associated\nattributes. We illustrate ORDENA's effectiveness in a set of case studies,\nwhich have also been elaborated in collaboration with domain experts. The\nproposed tool has also been evaluated by domain experts not involved in its\ndevelopment, which provided quite positive feedback about ORDENA."}

Standard\napproaches accomplish this task using variations on the Non-Rigid Iterative\nClosest Point (NRICP) algorithms, which are prone to local minima and sensitive\nto initial conditions. We instead formulate the non-rigid registration problem\nas a Signed Distance Function (SDF) matching optimization problem, which\nprovides richer shape information compared to traditional ICP methods. To avoid\ndegenerate solutions, we propose to use a smooth Skinning Eigenmode subspace to\nparameterize the optimization problem. Finally, we propose an adaptive subspace\noptimization scheme to allow the resolution of localized deformations within\nthe optimization. The result is a non-rigid registration algorithm that is more\nrobust than NRICP, without the parameter sensitivity present in other\nSDF-matching approaches."}

We study an asymmetric setting where voters face varying\nparticipation costs and share a possibly heuristic belief about their\npivotality (ability to influence the outcome).\n  In a costly voting setup where voters abstain if their participation cost is\ngreater than their pivotality estimate, we identify a single property of the\nheuristic belief -- weakly vanishing pivotality -- that gives rise to multiple\nstable equilibria in which elections are nearly tied. In contrast, strongly\nvanishing pivotality (as in the standard Calculus of Voting model) yields a\nunique, trivial equilibrium where only zero-cost voters participate as the\npopulation grows. We then characterize when nontrivial equilibria satisfy a\nversion of the Jury Theorem: below a sharp threshold, the majority-preferred\ncandidate wins with probability approaching one; above it, both candidates\neither win with equal probability."}

Our model generalizes\nclassical contextual pricing by accommodating richer agent action spaces. Over\n$T$ rounds with $d$-dimensional contexts, we establish an asymptotically tight\nexponential $T^{1 - \\Theta(1/d)}$ bound in terms of the pessimistic Stackelberg\nregret, benchmarked against the best utility for the principal that is\nconsistent with the observed feedback.\n  We also establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2d}})$ on\nthe classic Stackelberg regret for principal-agent games, demonstrating a\nsurprising double-exponential hardness separation from the contextual pricing\nproblem (a.k.a, the principal-agent game with two actions), which is known to\nadmit a near-optimal $O(d\\log\\log T)$ regret bound [Kleinberg and Leighton,\n2003, Leme and Schneider, 2018, Liu et al., 2021]. In particular, this\ndouble-exponential hardness separation occurs even in the special case with\nthree actions and two-dimensional context. We identify that this significant\nincrease in learning difficulty arises from a structural phenomenon that we\ncall contextual action degeneracy, where adversarially chosen contexts can make\nsome actions strictly dominated (and hence unincentivizable), blocking the\nprincipal's ability to explore or learn about them, and fundamentally limiting\nlearning progress."}
