Despite the scale of perpetual futures markets, ADL has received limited formal treatment as a sequential control problem. This paper provides a concise formalization of ADL as online learning on a PNL-haircut domain: at each round, the venue selects a solvency budget and a set of profitable trader accounts. The profitable accounts are liquidated to cover shortfalls up to the solvency budget, with the aim of recovering exchange-wide solvency. In this model, ADL haircuts apply to positive PNL (unrealized gains), not to posted collateral principal. Using our online learning model, we provide robustness results and theoretical upper bounds on how poorly a mechanism can perform at recovering solvency. We apply our model to the October 10, 2025 Hyperliquid stress episode. The regret caused by Hyperliquid's production ADL queue is about 50\\% of an upper bound on regret, calibrated to this event, while our optimized algorithm achieves about 2.6\\% of the same bound. In dollar terms, the production ADL model over liquidates trader profits by up to \\$51.7M. We also counterfactually evaluated algorithms inspired by our online learning framework that perform better and found that the best algorithm reduces overshoot to \\$3M. Our results provide simple, implementable mechanisms for improving ADL in live perpetuals exchanges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u53bb\u6760\u6746\uff08ADL\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6c38\u7eed\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c38\u7eed\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6e05\u7b97\u548c\u4fdd\u9669\u7f13\u51b2\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0cADL\u673a\u5236\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u6700\u540e\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cADL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06ADL\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u507f\u4ed8\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u4ea4\u6613\u8d26\u6237\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e05\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d26\u6237\u6765\u6062\u590d\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86ADL\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc72025\u5e74Hyperliquid\u538b\u529b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d85\u989d\u6e05\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684ADL\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c38\u7eed\u671f\u8d27\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We present a scalable approach for computing a PBE of an arbitrary two-player EFG. We adopt the definition of PBE enunciated by Bonanno in 2011 using a consistency concept based on the theory of belief revision due to Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson. Our algorithm for finding a PBE is an adaptation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that minimizes the expected regret at each information set given a belief system, while maintaining the necessary consistency criteria. We prove that our algorithm is correct for two-player zero-sum games and has a reasonable slowdown in time-complexity relative to classical CFR given the additional computation needed for refinement. We also experimentally demonstrate the competent performance of PBE-CFR in terms of equilibrium quality and running time on medium-to-large non-zero-sum EFGs. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of using PBE for strategy exploration in empirical game-theoretic analysis. Specifically, we compute PBE as a meta-strategy solver (MSS) in a tree-exploiting variant of Policy Space Response Oracles (TE-PSRO). Our experiments show that PBE as an MSS leads to higher-quality empirical EFG models with complex imperfect information structures compared to MSSs based on an unrefined Nash equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u5c55\u5f62\u5f0f\u6e38\u620f\uff08EFGs\uff09\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5747\u8861\uff08PBE\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u5c55\u5f62\u5f0f\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5747\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBonanno\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684PBE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u8ba2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08CFR\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97PBE\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cPBE-CFR\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u73a9\u5bb6\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u5747\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0cPBE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684EFG\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quivr\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "Quivr\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fee\u526a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\u5339\u914d\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "Quivr\u572817\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6b64\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "Quivr\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Our benchmarks capture a variety of problem types, including ones concerning privacy in AI systems that elicit sensitive information, and AI safety via testing of agents in simulation. Across 61 problem instances generated using this suite, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms for finding first-order optimal strategies in such problems. In particular, we introduce the family of regret matching (RM) algorithms for nonlinear constrained optimization. This class of parameter-free algorithms has enjoyed tremendous success in solving large two-player zero-sum games, but, surprisingly, they were hitherto relatively unexplored beyond that setting. Our key finding is that RM algorithms consistently outperform commonly employed first-order optimizers such as projected gradient descent, often by orders of magnitude.

Here, we are given a graph, called a topology, and a set of agents that need to be allocated to its vertices. Moreover, every agent has an ideal (and possibly different) distance in which to be from some of the other agents. Given an allocation of agents, each one of them suffers a cost that is the sum of the differences from the ideal distance for each agent in their subset. The goal is to decide whether there is a stable allocation of the agents, i.e., no agent would like to deviate from their location. Specifically, we consider three different stability notions: envy-freeness, swap stability, and jump stability. We perform a comprehensive study of the (parameterized) complexity of the problem in three different dimensions: the topology of the graph, the number of agents, and the structure of preferences of the agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u56fe\u5f62\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u6301\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u914d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u914d\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u914d\u5230\u56fe\u7684\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4ea4\u6362\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u56fe\u5f62\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u6301\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
