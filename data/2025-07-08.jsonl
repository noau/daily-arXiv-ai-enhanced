In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)\ndefines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural\nrendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning\nprocess; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the\ninteraction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately\nenhancing overall facial expressiveness.

The platform has two sides of agents, an\ninitiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects\nagents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the\nresponding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating\nagents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections.\nA match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating\npair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This\nsetting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches\nunder submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our\nrevenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of\npolynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In\nparticular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm\nthat achieves a $(\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any\n$\\epsilon > 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various\nagent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and\nadaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any\ngiven responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \\frac{1}{e} -\n\\epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common\nrevenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm\nachieving a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear\nprogramming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties\nof the revenue functions."}

The single-facility variant of\nthis problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social\ncost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism\nis $\\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by\nrelaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility\nlocation literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which\nno agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor.\nBecause the aforementioned $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to\nconstant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing\nthe facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main\nresult is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate\nand constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small\nchange in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution.\nMotivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation\nliterature, our second main result is a constant-approximate,\nconstant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism."}

Akbarpour and Li (2020)\nargue that any revenue-optimal, truthful, and credible mechanism requires\nunbounded communication. Recent works (Ferreira and Weinberg, 2020; Essaidi et\nal., 2022; Chitra et al., 2024) circumvent their impossibility for the\nsingle-item setting through the use of cryptographic commitments and\nblockchains. We extend their results to matroid feasibility constraints.\n  At a high level, the two-round Deferred-Revelation Auction (DRA) discussed by\nFerreira and Weinberg (2020) and Chitra et al., (2024) requires each bidder to\nsubmit a deposit, which is slashed upon presenting verifiable evidence\nindicating a deviation from the behaviour prescribed by the mechanism. We prove\nthat the DRA satisfies truthfulness, credibility and revenue-optimality for all\nmatroid environments when bidders' values are drawn from $\\alpha$-strongly\nregular distributions for $\\alpha > 0$. Further, we argue that the DRA is not\ncredible for any feasibility constraint beyond matroids and for any smaller\ndeposits than suggested by previous literature even in single-item\nenvironments.\n  Finally, we modify the Ascending Deferred-Revelation Auction (ADRA) for\nsingle-item settings proposed by Essaidi et al., (2022) for arbitrary bidder\nvalue distributions. We implement a deferred-revelation variant of the\ndeferred-acceptance auction for matroids due to Bikhchandani et al., (2011),\nwhich requires the same bounded communication as the ADRA."}

Here we\nundertake a critical re-examination: we begin with integer and dyadic games and\nidentify subtle inconsistencies and oversights in the established literature\n(e.g. Siegel 2013), most notably, the lack of distinction between a game being\na number and a game being equal to a number. After addressing this, we move to\nthe general theory of number games. We analyze Conway's original definition and\na later refinement by Siegel, and highlight conceptual gaps that have largely\ngone unnoticed. Through a careful dissection of these issues, we propose a more\ncoherent and robust formulation. Specifically, we develop a refined\ncharacterization of numbers, via several subclasses, dyadics, canonical forms,\ntheir group theoretic closure and zugzwangs, that altogether better capture the\nessence of number games. This reconciliation not only clarifies existing\nambiguities but also uncovers several open problems."}
