To address this issue, we\npropose WaFusion, a novel framework combining wavelet decomposition and\ndiffusion models to generate high-quality, realistic morphed face images\nefficiently. WaFusion leverages the structural details captured by wavelet\ntransforms and the generative capabilities of diffusion models, producing face\nmorphs with minimal artifacts. Experiments conducted on FERET, FRGC, FRLL, and\nWVU Twin datasets demonstrate WaFusion's superiority over state-of-the-art\nmethods, producing high-resolution morphs with fewer artifacts. Our framework\nexcels across key biometric metrics, including the Attack Presentation\nClassification Error Rate (APCER), Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error\nRate (BPCER), and Equal Error Rate (EER). This work sets a new benchmark in\nbiometric morph generation, offering a cutting-edge and efficient solution to\nenhance biometric security systems."}

However,\nexisting 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face\nsignificant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as\nincomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To\naddress these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization\nframework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting\nand 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach\ndivides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling\ntargeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global\nstructural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through\nvoxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate\ngeometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate\nlighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D\nwavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance\nvariations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail\nreconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global\nstructure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing\nexisting approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction."}

Subsequently, a dynamic\nnetwork with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with\nkinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.\nThis dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging\nmotion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time\ninference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose\nsequences.

To enable effective\nvisualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis\ntechniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate\nnovel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on\nreconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization\nexploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a\nnovel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and\ntracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and\nanalysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic\nvolumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate\nsegmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for\ncoarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network\nfor fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results\nwithin the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous\ntracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nVolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against\nstate-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in\nreal time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS\noffers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework\nunlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis\nand visualization."}

In this paper we introduce\nfirst-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD\nwith little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three\nloosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code\ntransformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward\nlifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order\narray language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable\naspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for\nhigher-order code.\n  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a\ncarefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and\n'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)\nhigher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially\npresented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting\ndual numbers to \"dual arrays\" to work without much modification."}

Strikingly, we demonstrate that these improvements\nvanish with multiple buyers: both general and structured distributions\n(including regular/MHR) share identical asymptotic performance, achieving\npricing query complexity of $\\widetilde\\Theta\\left(\\varepsilon^{-3}\\right)$ and\nregret of $\\widetilde\\Theta\\left(T^{2/3}\\right)$.\n  This result reveals a dichotomy between single-agent and multi-agent\nenvironments.

However,\nLLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature\nsuggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to\noffer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees\ncould improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable\nnatural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.\nTo address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language\nthat can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural\nlanguage-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using\nsuch a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the\nuser's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the\nAnsible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a\ncalculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic\ninterpreter which is used for the verification.
