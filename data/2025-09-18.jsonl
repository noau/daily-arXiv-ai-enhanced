However, in practice, good\nperformance of an application is viewed as more of a binary function - either\nthe application responds in under, say 100 ms, and is fast enough for a user to\nbarely notice, or it takes a noticeable amount of time, leaving the user\nwaiting and potentially abandoning the task. Thus, performance really means how\noften the application is fast enough to be usable, leading industrial\ndevelopers to focus on the 95th and 99th percentile tail-latencies as heavily,\nor moreso, than average response time. Our vision is to create a software stack\nthat actively supports these needs via programming language and runtime system\ndesign. In this paper we present a novel garbage-collector design, the Catalpa\ncollector, for the Bosque programming language and runtime. This allocator is\ndesigned to minimize latency and variability while maintaining high-throughput\nand incurring small memory overheads. To achieve these goals we leverage\nvarious features of the Bosque language, including immutability and\nreference-cycle freedom, to construct a collector that has bounded collection\npauses, incurs fixed-constant memory overheads, and does not require any\nbarriers or synchronization with application code."}

While current watermarking techniques have the potential to identify\nthe code LM to protect its IP, they have limitations when facing the more\npractical and complex demand, i.e., offering the individual user-level tracing\nin the black-box setting. This work presents CLMTracing, a black-box code LM\nwatermarking framework employing the rule-based watermarks and\nutility-preserving injection method for user-level model tracing.

Understanding time inconsistency and designing\nappropriate interventions is a key research challenge in computer science and\nbehavioral economics. Previous work focuses on progress-based tasks and derives\na closed-form description of agent behavior, from which they obtain optimal\nintervention strategies. They model time-inconsistency using the\n$\\beta$-$\\delta$ discounting (quasi-hyperbolic discounting), but the analysis\nis limited to the case $\\delta = 1$.

However, computing the\naverage strategy requires significant computational resources or introduces\nadditional errors, limiting its practical applicability. The Reward\nTransformation (RT) framework was introduced to regret minimization to achieve\nlast-iterate convergence through reward function regularization. However, it\nfaces practical challenges: its performance is highly sensitive to manually\ntuned parameters, which often deviate from theoretical convergence conditions,\nleading to slow convergence, oscillations, or stagnation in local optima.\n  Inspired by previous work, we propose an adaptive technique to address these\nissues, ensuring better consistency between theoretical guarantees and\npractical performance for RT Regret Matching (RTRM), RT Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (RTCFR), and their variants in solving NFGs and EFGs more\neffectively. Our adaptive methods dynamically adjust parameters, balancing\nexploration and exploitation while improving regret accumulation, ultimately\nenhancing asymptotic last-iterate convergence and achieving linear convergence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly accelerate\nconvergence, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms."}

Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by\nplayerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results\non the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they\nrely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By\nleveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into\nthe contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we\ngive an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having\nestablished existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via\nindependent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities\nadmit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible\nregion, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive\nstepsizes.

Generalised reachability games, studied\nby Fijalkow and Horn, are a generalisation of reachability objectives, where\ninstead of a single target set, there is a family of target sets and Eve must\nvisit all of them in any order. In this work, we further study the complexity\nof solving two-player games on graphs with generalised reachability objectives.\nOur results are twofold: first, we provide an improved complexity picture for\ngeneralised reachability games, expanding the known tractable class from games\nin which all target sets are singleton to additionally allowing a logarithmic\nnumber of target sets of arbitrary size. Second, we study optimisation variants\nof generalised reachability with a focus on the size of the target sets. For\nthese problems, we show intractability for most interesting cases.\nParticularly, in contrast to the tractability in the classic variant for\nsingleton target sets, the optimisation problem is NP-hard when Eve tries to\nmaximise the number of singleton target sets that are visited. Tractability can\nbe recovered in the optimisation setting when all target sets are singleton by\nrequiring that Eve pledges a maximum sized subset of target sets that she can\nguarantee to visit."}
