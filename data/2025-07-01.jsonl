To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS.

In this\npaper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, not only as a\nnatural phenomenon but as a programmable mechanism for generating specific RNA\ntarget sequences from DNA templates. The problem we address is whether we can\nencode a set of RNA sequences for a given system onto a DNA template word,\nensuring that all the sequences are generated through co-transcriptional\nsplicing.

Our\nframework proves properties on index functions by distilling them into\nalgebraic (in)equalities and discharging them to a Fourier-Motzkin-based\nsolver.

Moreover, even under strategy-proof mechanisms, agents may\nstrategically misreport preferences based on beliefs about admission chances.\nWe introduce a two-stage stochastic matching problem with uncertain\npreferences, using school choice as a case study. In the first stage, the\nclearinghouse expands schools' capacities before observing students' reported\npreferences. Students either report their true preferences, producing exogenous\nuncertainty, or act strategically, submitting reported preferences based on\ntheir true preferences and admission chances (which depend on capacities),\nintroducing endogenous uncertainty. In the second stage, the clearinghouse\ncomputes the student-optimal stable matching based on schools' priorities and\nstudents' reported preferences. In strategic cases, endogenous reported\npreferences are utility-maximizing transformations of capacity decisions and\nexogenous true preferences; we handle uncertainty using sample average\napproximation(SAA). We develop behavior-based mathematical formulations and,\ndue to problem complexity, propose Lagrangian- and local-search-based\nbehavior-specific heuristics for near-optimal solutions.

The two most prominent and widely studied types of\nlinear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to\nthe same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these\ntwo layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the\nlinear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single\nstack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts\nhave been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue\nfor storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted\ngraphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page\nare stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show\nthat there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority\nqueues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout\nwith a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an\nefficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority\nqueues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the\npathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of\ntreewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of\npriority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed."}

In this paper, we study EWPM and its variants. The EWPM\nproblem is famous, since in the case of unary encoded weights, Mulmuley,\nVazirani, and Vazirani showed almost 40 years ago that the problem can be\nsolved in randomized polynomial time. However, up to this date no\nderandomization is known.\n  Our first result is a simple deterministic algorithm for EWPM that runs in\ntime $n^{O(\\ell)}$, where $\\ell$ is the number of distinct weights that perfect\nmatchings in $G$ can take.

To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to study this problem. As a consequence, the latter\nproblem is contained in RP if the weights are encoded in unary.

Existing learning-based approaches often rely on\ndiscretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to\ninefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes\nto prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can\nbe equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The\ncore idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial\nGroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally\napproximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we\ndevelop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous\nsampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order\noptimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees\ntruthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental\nevaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves\nstrong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.\n  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without\noutcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency.

To address these issues, we introduce\n\\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video\nstabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'\nparadigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict\nGaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view\ndynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to\nproduce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to\nrender each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid\nframe cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with\n3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene\ndynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to\nstate-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics\nand new geometry consistency.

(1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory\nand practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent\napproximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so\nfar, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner\nproblem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple\napproximations algorithms. In general, our Adapted Greedy achieves the first\nunconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the\nindependence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and\nweight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned\nmultiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners.\nFurther, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight\nguarantees.
