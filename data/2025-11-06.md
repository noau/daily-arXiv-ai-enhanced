  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Neural SDFs在CAD表面重建中依赖梯度和平滑度正则化，但FlatCAD采用的固定ODW权重限制了细节恢复和优化的灵活性。

Method: 论文探讨了多种ODW损失权重的调度策略，包括恒定、线性、五次和逐步插值，以及预热递增变体，以动态调整正则化强度。

Result: 在ABC CAD数据集上的实验表明，动态调度策略显著优于固定权重方法，Chamfer Distance最高提升了35%。

Conclusion: 通过动态调整ODW损失权重，论文证明了其在提升CAD重建精度和细节恢复方面的有效性。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation
for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both
gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and
preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten
(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating
full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,
FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:
strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail
recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss
that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively
decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,
quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up
variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying
schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a
35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing
scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for
robust CAD reconstruction.

### [2] [Visualization Biases MLLM's Decision Making in Network Data Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03617)
*Timo Brand,Henry Förster,Stephen G. Kobourov,Jacob Miller*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 研究发现可视化技术能提升MLLM对网络桥梁判断的置信度，但也可能导致偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可视化技术对MLLM判断网络桥梁存在与否的影响，及其潜在偏见。

Method: 通过比较结构化文本输入与可视化输入的效果，评估MLLM的判断变化。

Result: 可视化提升MLLM置信度，但也产生偏见，无论桥梁是否存在。

Conclusion: 需谨慎在生成式AI应用中使用可视化，以避免不必要的幻觉效应。

Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the
presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of
visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could
theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we
observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards
accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or
not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that
the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's
judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply
that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations
in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.

### [3] [Branch-and-Cut for Computing Approximate Equilibria of Mixed-Integer Generalized Nash Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03340)
*Aloïs Duguet,Tobias Harks,Martin Schmidt,Julian Schwarz*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了混合整数变量的广义纳什均衡问题，提出了一种结合乘性和加性松弛优化的近似均衡概念，并设计了分支切割法来计算或证明其存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于混合整数变量广义纳什均衡问题通常难以存在精确均衡，且玩家解决非凸问题的能力有限，因此研究近似均衡具有实际意义。

Method: 论文提出了一种分支切割法，结合了交集切割的思想，并证明了在线性约束和玩家成本函数为凸或凹的条件下，这种切割的存在性。对于标准纳什均衡问题，还引入了另一种切割类型以保证有限终止。

Result: 研究展示了该方法的有效性，并通过数值实验验证了其在混合整数流量游戏中的应用。

Conclusion: 基于分支切割法，论文还提出了一个单树二分搜索方法，以在简化假设下计算最佳近似均衡，为混合整数变量均衡问题的求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables constitute
an important class of games in which each player solves a mixed-integer
optimization problem, where both the objective and the feasible set is
parameterized by the rivals' strategies. However, such games are known for
failing to admit exact equilibria and also the assumption of all players being
able to solve nonconvex problems to global optimality is questionable. This
motivates the study of approximate equilibria. In this work, we consider an
approximation concept that incorporates both multiplicative and additive
relaxations of optimality. We propose a branch-and-cut (B&C) method that
computes such approximate equilibria or proves its non-existence. For this, we
adopt the idea of intersection cuts and show the existence of such cuts under
the condition that the constraints are linear and each player's cost function
is either convex in the entire strategy profile, or, concave in the entire
strategy profile and linear in the rivals' strategies. For the special case of
standard Nash equilibrium problems, we introduce an alternative type of cut and
show that the method terminates finitely, provided that each player has only
finitely many distinct best-response sets. Finally, on the basis of the B&C
method, we introduce a single-tree binary-search method to compute
best-approximate equilibria under some simplifying assumptions. We implemented
these methods and present numerical results for a class of mixed-integer flow
games.

### [4] [Non-Monotonicity in Fair Division of Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03629)
*Hadi Hosseini,Shraddha Pathak,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了图顶点公平分配问题，利用割值衡量捆绑价值，探索了EF1（无嫉妒至多一项）与转移稳定性（TS）的关系，发现其存在性随代理人数变化呈非单调性，并提出了高效算法保证其存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决图顶点分配问题，特别是在如团队形成和网络分区等应用中，评价函数是非单调的，即边际价值可能为正、负或零。研究重点在于理解EF1与效率概念（如TS）的兼容性。

Method: 通过分析图的割值模型，探索EF1与TS的关系。对于一般图和森林，研究了不同代理人数下的分配存在性，并通过高效算法实现。

Result: 发现EF1和TS的分配在代理人数为2时总是存在，在n=3时可能不存在，但对n≥4再次存在。通过弱化效率要求或限制图为森林，可以保证所有n下的存在性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，EF1与TS的兼容性随代理人数变化呈现非单调性，但通过调整条件或限制图结构，可以实现公平且高效的分配。

Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating the vertices of a graph among
$n$ agents, where the value of a bundle is determined by its cut value -- the
number of edges with exactly one endpoint in the bundle. This model naturally
captures applications such as team formation and network partitioning, where
valuations are inherently non-monotonic: the marginal values may be positive,
negative, or zero depending on the composition of the bundle. We focus on the
fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and explore its
compatibility with several efficiency concepts such as Transfer Stability (TS)
that prohibits single-item transfers that benefit one agent without making the
other worse-off. For general graphs, our results uncover a non-monotonic
relationship between the number of agents $n$ and the existence of allocations
satisfying EF1 and transfer stability (TS): such allocations always exist for
$n=2$, may fail to exist for $n=3$, but exist again for all $n\geq 4$. We
further show that existence can be guaranteed for any $n$ by slightly weakening
the efficiency requirement or by restricting the graph to forests. All of our
positive results are achieved via efficient algorithms.
