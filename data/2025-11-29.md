Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

### [2] [Optimism in Equality Saturation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20782)
*Russel Arbore,Alvin Cheung,Max Willsey*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于抽象解释的算法，用于在等式饱和过程中精确分析循环程序，从而提高程序优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的e-class分析技术在分析循环程序（如SSA形式的程序）时表现悲观且无效，限制了等式饱和技术的优化潜力。

Method: 论文引入了一种抽象解释算法，能够在等式饱和过程中精确分析循环，并结合非破坏性重写技术，形成统一的乐观分析和重写算法。

Result: 通过在一个基于新SSA语义的原型抽象解释器上实例化该方法，能够比clang和gcc更精确地分析简单示例程序。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的方法，解决了现有技术在分析循环程序时的局限性，为程序优化提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [3] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 立方型理论（如Cubical Agda）相较于马丁-洛夫型理论的优点包括高阶归纳类型（HITs）的实例——商归纳类型（QITs）以及可证明的函数外延性。然而，HoTT中的无限层次等式可能难以处理。幸运的是，即使将立方型理论的等式层次截断为单纯同伦集（h-Sets），QITs和函数外延性仍能保留。文章提出了两种在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set立方型理论的方法，并分析了它们的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立方型理论在截断等式层次后仍保留QITs和函数外延性的可行性，解决HoTT中无限层次等式带来的复杂性。

Method: 分析了两种在Cubical Agda中实现h-Set立方型理论的方法：一种是放弃理论的规范性并假设UIP公理，另一种是通过手动证明每个类型的UIP。此外，还实现了一个无Glue的Cubical Agda变体，为未来UIP的实现做准备。

Result: 证明了在截断等式层次后，立方型理论仍能保留QITs和函数外延性，并展示了两种实现方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 文章得出结论，尽管手动证明UIP的方法繁琐，但适合自动化实现，并提出了一个兼容UIP的无Glue立方型理论变体，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

### [4] [SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509)
*Dirk Beyer,Gidon Ernst,Martin Jonáš,Marian Lingsch-Rosenfeld*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SV-LIB，一种用于软件验证任务的交换格式和中间语言，旨在促进跨语言的技术转移和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证工具多为特定语言设计，而许多验证方法实际上与语言无关，因此需要一个通用的交换格式来支持跨语言的验证任务。

Method: SV-LIB基于命令式编程语言的常用概念，使用SMT-LIB表示程序中的表达式和类型，易于解析并集成到现有基础设施中。同时定义了验证结果的格式及其验证任务。

Result: 本文介绍了SV-LIB 1.0版本的设计目标、语法和非正式语义，提供了跨语言验证的基础。

Conclusion: SV-LIB为软件验证任务提供了通用的交换格式，未来计划扩展其形式化语义和支持并发性。

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.

### [6] [Utilitarian Guarantees for the Method of Equal Shares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20929)
*Anton Baychkov,Markus Brill,Jannik Peters*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了参与式预算（PB）中的公平性与比例性与总效用福利之间的关系，特别关注了等份额法（MES）的最小效用福利保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，PB研究更加注重满足公平性与比例性的规则，但比例性可能以牺牲总效用福利为代价。本文旨在量化这种关系。

Method: 通过分析一组称为DNS函数的满意度函数，本文推导出MES的最小效用福利保障，并将其参数化为项目成本的最小和最大值。

Result: 研究发现，MES的效用保障在项目成本相等的条件下可简化为现有的多赢家保障，并且该保障在满足扩展合理性表示的规则中渐近紧密。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在满足比例性的规则中，MES能够达到最佳的效用保障，说明没有其他比例性规则能比MES更好地平衡比例性与效用福利。

Abstract: In recent years, research in Participatory Budgeting (PB) has put a greater emphasis on rules satisfying notions of fairness and proportionality, with the Method of Equal Shares (MES) being a prominent example. However, proportionality can come at a cost to the total utilitarian welfare. Our work formalizes this relationship, by deriving minimum utilitarian welfare guarantees for MES for a subclass of satisfaction functions called DNS functions, which includes two of the most popular ways of measuring a voter's utility in the PB setting: considering (1) the total cost of approved projects or (2) the total number of those projects. Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal. We show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight for rules satisfying Extended Justified Representation up to one project, showing that no proportional rule can achieve a better utilitarian guarantee than MES.

### [7] [Cycle Cancellation for Submodular Fractional Allocations and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21099)
*Chandra Chekuri,Pooja Kulkarni,Ruta Mehta,Jan Vondrak*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种离散分配问题，提出了一种适用于子模估值的循环消除算法，并展示了其在三个经典分配目标中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在子模估值下的离散分配问题，并扩展现有循环消除方法的应用范围。

Method: 通过使用多线性扩展来保证代理价值不减的情况下，消除分数分配的支撑图中的循环。

Result: 为子模NSW问题提供了1/5近似算法，为MMS问题提供了1/2(1-1/e)近似算法，并在特定情况下获得了最优或最知名的近似算法。

Conclusion: 本文的新算法和结果为子模估值下的分配问题提供了有效的解决方案，扩展了现有方法的应用范围。

Abstract: We consider discrete allocation problem where $m$ indivisible goods are to be divided among $n$ agents. When agents' valuations are additive, the well-known cycle cancelling lemma by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos plays a key role in design and analysis of rounding algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove an analogous lemma for the case of submodular valuations. Our algorithm removes cycles in the support graph of a fractional allocation while guaranteeing that each agent's value, measured using the multilinear extension, does not decrease.
  We demonstrate applications of the cycle-canceling algorithm, along with other ideas, to obtain new algorithms and results for three well-studied allocation objectives: max-min (Santa Claus problem), Nash social welfare (NSW), and maximin-share (MMS). For the submodular NSW problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{5}$-approximation; for the MMS problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$-approximation through new simple algorithms. For various special cases where the goods are "small" valued or the number of agents is constant, we obtain tight/best-known approximation algorithms. All our results are in the value-oracle model.

Conclusion: 本文不仅解决了劳务市场中试错动态的收敛性问题，还提供了竞争均衡局部稳定性的完整刻画。

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of tâtonnement dynamics in markets with chores. Tâtonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.
  Analyzing tâtonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the tâtonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that naïve tâtonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative tâtonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].
  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \in (1, \infty)$, we show that relative tâtonnement converges to an $\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability.

### [9] [Choosing What Game to Play without Selecting Equilibria: Inferring Safe (Pareto) Improvements in Binary Constraint Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21262)
*Caspar Oesterheld,Vincent Conitzer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在多代理游戏中如何通过结果对应假设来推导安全改进关系，证明在特定条件下规则是完全的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决在多均衡情况下，如何通过合理的假设比较不同游戏的优劣，从而选择对某些玩家或社会偏好更有利的游戏。

Method: 方法包括分析结果对应假设的推导复杂性，研究一套自然推理规则的（不）完全性，并在特定假设下证明其完全性。

Result: 结果表明，在一般条件下推导安全改进关系是co-NP完全的，但在自然假设下推理规则是完全的。

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管一般情况下规则不完全，但在合理假设下可以确保其完备性，为游戏选择提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider a setting in which a principal gets to choose which game from some given set is played by a group of agents. The principal would like to choose a game that favors one of the players, the social preferences of the players, or the principal's own preferences. Unfortunately, given the potential multiplicity of equilibria, it is conceptually unclear how to tell which of even any two games is better. Oesterheld et al. (2022) propose that we use assumptions about outcome correspondence -- i.e., about how the outcomes of different games relate -- to allow comparisons in some cases. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.
  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete. However, we also show that under natural, generally applicable assumptions about outcome correspondence the rules are complete.
