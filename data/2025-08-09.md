### [1] [Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825)
*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Voost是一个统一的、可扩展的框架，通过使用单一扩散变换器联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱，实现了更精准的服装与人体对应关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟试穿技术面临的主要挑战是如何在姿势和外观变化下准确建模服装与人体的对应关系。传统的任务特定网络、辅助损失或额外标签方法限制了其灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: Voost通过联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，利用单一扩散变换器实现双向监督。此外，引入了两种推理时技术：注意力温度缩放以增强对分辨率或掩模变化的鲁棒性，以及利用任务间双向一致性的自校正采样。

Result: Voost在试穿和试脱基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，在对齐精度、视觉逼真度和泛化能力上均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: Voost通过联合学习和推理优化技术，显著提升了虚拟试穿和试脱任务的性能，展示了其在大规模应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

### [2] [Perceive-Sample-Compress: Towards Real-Time 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04965)
*Zijian Wang,Beizhen Zhao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的感知-采样-压缩框架，用于改进3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在大规模场景管理和高效存储方面的性能，同时保持实时渲染速度和高视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3DGS表示在处理大规模场景或复杂环境时，往往面临资源管理和存储效率的挑战。论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种感知-采样-压缩框架，包括场景感知补偿算法、金字塔采样表示和广义高斯混合模型压缩算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了内存效率和高视觉质量，同时保持了实时渲染速度。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效地解决了3DGS在大规模场景管理和存储方面的局限性，同时提升了视觉质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

### [3] [Laplacian Analysis Meets Dynamics Modelling: Gaussian Splatting for 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04966)
*Yifan Zhou,Beizhen Zhao,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合显隐式功能的新型动态3DGS框架，解决了现有方法在动态场景建模中因频谱冲突导致的问题，通过谱感知拉普拉斯编码和改进高斯动力学属性，实现了更优的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS方法在建模动态场景时，由于频谱冲突导致运动细节保留和变形一致性维护的困难，要么过度平滑，要么特征碰撞。为此，需要一种新的方法来综合解决这些问题。

Method: 采用混合显隐式功能框架，结合谱感知拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动力学属性和基于KDTree的自适应高斯分割策略，以灵活控制频率运动、补偿光度扭曲并优化动态区域。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中表现出最先进的性能，显著提升了重建保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的动态3DGS框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过频谱感知和自适应优化实现了更高质量的动态场景建模。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding
using Gaussian Splatting.

### [5] [RAP: Real-time Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05115)
*Fangyu Du,Taiqing Li,Ziwei Zhang,Qian Qiao,Tan Yu,Dingcheng Zhen,Xu Jia,Yang Yang,Shunshun Yin,Siyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RAP是一个实时音频驱动肖像动画的统一框架，通过混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练-推理范式，实现了高质量、实时性强的肖像动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能生成高质量的肖像动画，但由于计算复杂度高，难以满足实时部署的需求。RAP旨在解决这一问题，同时保持高质量的动画效果。

Method: RAP采用混合注意力机制实现细粒度音频控制，并通过静态-动态训练-推理范式避免显式的运动监督。

Result: 实验表明，RAP在实时约束下实现了最先进的性能，能够精确控制音频驱动，减少时间漂移，并保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RAP成功地在实时性和高质量动画生成之间找到了平衡，为音频驱动肖像动画的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量上优于3DGS，并在多种场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的密度控制方法显著提升了3D高斯分布点原语管理的效果，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Reeb图绘制算法无法满足边界约束、紧凑性和梯度对齐这三个重要性质，导致视觉化结果不够准确。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入了一种名为GASP的算法，该算法在绘制Reeb图时考虑了边界约束、紧凑性和梯度对齐这三个性质。

Result: 通过与几何质心算法的定性和定量比较，证明了GASP算法的视觉化结果更能准确反映底层数据的拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GASP算法生成的Reeb图在视觉化效果上优于现有算法，能够更准确地表示数据的拓扑结构。

Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法为服装建模提供了一种有效的分层分割解决方案，能够同时识别多层服装和身体部分，推动了服装仿真技术的发展。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Result: 该方法能够在野外场景中实现物理精确且逼真的光照编辑，为3D图形工具提供类似的光照控制能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法将传统3D图形工具的光照控制能力引入了野外场景的光照编辑中，为自监督场景光照提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

### [10] [Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829)

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一个保证混合模式更新一致性的算法，利用服务行为的语义特性（如可交换性），并通过理论框架证明其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线服务通常采用微服务架构，但动态更新服务功能时，新旧版本的Worker并行运行可能导致数据不一致。现有方法要么效率低下，要么缺乏控制，因此需要一种能保证一致性的更新方法。

Method: 论文提出了基于服务行为语义特性的算法（如可交换性），并通过理论框架形式化一致性要求。

Result: 证明了语义无感知的更新方法无法避免不一致性，并开发了新的算法来保证混合模式更新的原子性。

Conclusion: 通过语义感知和理论框架，论文成功解决了混合模式更新的一致性问题，并验证了算法的正确性。

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

### [11] [Online EFX Allocations with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04779)
*Themistoklis Melissourgos,Nicos Protopapas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线公平分配问题，探索了如何在使用预测的情况下实现近似EFX分配，但在大多数情况下，即使有预测也难以实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决在线公平分配问题，即在物品按顺序到达时需要立即分配，目标是实现最终的无嫉妒性（EFX），但发现近似EFX分配在一般情况下是不可实现的。

Method: 论文提出利用预测向量（如机器学习模型生成）来辅助分配算法，并测量预测的误差。研究了忽略预测、仅依赖预测以及结合预测和真实值的算法的效果。

Result: 研究结果表明，即使有预测，近似EFX分配仍然存在严格的下界限制。但在两个具有相同估值的代理情况下，提出了一个算法，其EFX近似效果随预测准确性提高而改善。

Conclusion: 结论指出，在线公平分配问题中实现EFX具有挑战性，预测的使用可以部分改善结果，但在大多数情况下仍然存在局限性。

Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good
arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be
immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to
ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.
Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in
general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting
algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine
learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we
measure their error using the total variation distance from the true
valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with
the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility
results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore
predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both
the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the
prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate
EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary
to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the
necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.
The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy
of the predictions increases.

Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex
systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across
edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more
from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be
balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs),
users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in
terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these
heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with
multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a
fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we
propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee
energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a
social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and
numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and
energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive
services.

Motivation: 传统桥牌游戏中的固定伙伴关系限制了游戏的动态性和灵活性，因此作者提出了一种新的三人桥牌版本，以消除这种限制。

Method: 通过动态重新定义团队组成和引入新颖的计分系统，强制玩家进行战术决策和风险评估。游戏规则基于常规桥牌规则，但要求玩家在没有固定伙伴关系的情况下实时调整策略。

Result: 模拟结果显示，多样化的策略在这种游戏架构下表现高效。该游戏设计适合竞赛，并可能扩大锦标赛纸牌游戏的参赛群体。

Abstract: This article presents a new three-player version of the bridge playing card
game for the purpose of ending fixed partnerships so that the play can be more
dynamic and flexible. By dynamically redefining team makeup in real time, this
game design increases unpredictability and forces players to repeatedly update
strategy. A novel scoring system is introduced to reduce biases present in
conventional rule-based games by favoring fairness via reward systems that
enforce tactical decision making and risk assessment. Being subject to regular
bridge rules, this version tests players to collaborate without fixed
friendships, requiring fluid adjustment and adaptive bidding behavior in real
time. Strategic issues involve aggressive and defensive bidding, adaptable
playing styles, and loss-seeking strategies specific to the three-player
structure. The article discusses probabilistic issues of bidding, trump and
no-trump declarative effects, and algorithmic methods to trick-taking.
Simulation outcomes illustrate the efficiency of diverse strategies. The game's
architecture is ideal for competitions and possibly influential in broadening
entry pools for tournament card games.
