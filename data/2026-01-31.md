### [1] [Mesh Splatting for End-to-end Multiview Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21400)
*Ruiqi Zhang,Jiacheng Wu,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过将表面表示可微分地转化为体积表示的方法，实现了通过体绘制进行端到端表面重建的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，体积表示虽然能稳定高效地进行优化，但后续网格化会导致过高密度的网格和误差累积；而纯表面方法虽然避免了网格化，却难以捕捉复杂几何细节且依赖先验。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将网格软化为一组半透明层，使其保持与基础网格的可微性，并结合基于溅射的渲染器和拓扑控制策略，实现了表面到体积的可微分转换。

Result: 该方法可在约20分钟内完成优化，实现准确的表面重建，并显著提高网格质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功地将表面与体积表示的优势结合起来，为复杂几何体的重建提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Surfaces are typically represented as meshes, which can be extracted from volumetric fields via meshing or optimized directly as surface parameterizations. Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合渲染方法，结合了流式注视点路径追踪和轻量级高斯泼溅技术，实现了高质量、交互式和沉浸式的医学解剖可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的2D切片方法难以解释空间关系，而直接的体积路径追踪和VR渲染计算成本高，预计算表示如高斯泼溅需要提前规划，这些方法限制了交互使用。

Method: 采用混合渲染方法，结合流式注视点路径追踪和轻量级高斯泼溅近似技术，通过体积数据优化边缘模型生成，并利用注视点渲染持续改进。

Result: 该方法在视觉质量上保留了直接路径追踪和高斯泼溅的优势，同时能够在不到一秒内重新生成边缘模型，无需大量预处理和近似计算。

Conclusion: 这一方法为交互式医学可视化提供了新的可能性，消除了预处理和近似计算的限制。

Abstract: Volumetric medical imaging offers great potential for understanding complex pathologies. Yet, traditional 2D slices provide little support for interpreting spatial relationships, forcing users to mentally reconstruct anatomy into three dimensions. Direct volumetric path tracing and VR rendering can improve perception but are computationally expensive, while precomputed representations, like Gaussian Splatting, require planning ahead. Both approaches limit interactive use.
  We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.
  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations. This opens new options for interactive medical visualization.

Conclusion: 通过利用音频-视觉模型的丰富生成先验，本研究提供了一种高效且高质量的视频配音解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.

Method: 采用满足性模理论（SMT）求解器实现最优软件流水线，展示其可行性并用于反馈分析。

Result: 该方法显著优于启发式算法和手动优化，并能解释特定启动间隔不可行的原因。

Conclusion: 基于SMT求解器的软件流水线方法是高效的，同时提供了有价值的反馈机制。

Abstract: Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模对称博弈中的近似纳什均衡，旨在验证均值场博弈的均衡解是否能提供有效的近似均衡策略。

Method: 通过静态模型和动态连续时间场景，分析了策略的均衡性。特别关注代理标准依赖于控制状态过程的条件的场景。

Result: 验证了策略满足$Ł^\infty$近似纳什均衡的概念，确保了在任何初始特征下，个体偏差收益均较小且一致。

Conclusion: 研究证实均值场博弈的均衡解在大规模对称博弈中可作为有效的近似纳什均衡策略，适用于静态和动态场景。

Abstract: In the context of large population symmetric games, approximate Nash equilibria are introduced through equilibrium solutions of the corresponding mean field game in the sense that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation under such strategies converges to zero in the large population size asymptotic. We show that these strategies satisfy an $Ł^\infty$ notion of approximate Nash equilibrium which guarantees that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation is small uniformly among players and uniformly on their initial characteristics. We establish these results in the context of static models and in the dynamic continuous time setting, and we cover situations where the agents' criteria depend on the conditional law of the controlled state process.

### [6] [Shortlisting: a Principled Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21277)
*Edith Elkind,Qishen Han,Lirong Xia*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文将短选问题的重要性引入研究视野，区分其与相关问题，提供初步思考，并呼吁更多研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着参与式决策需求的增长和候选空间的扩大，高效且公平的短选程序需求迫切，但目前缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 这是一篇前瞻性论文，旨在强调短选的重要性，区分其与相关问题，并提出初步思考。

Result: 论文提出了短选问题的研究价值，并展望了其减少认知负担、实现公平集体决策、促进广泛参与和增强民主系统信任的潜力。

Conclusion: 短选问题亟待系统性研究，作者呼吁学术界关注这一领域，以实现其潜在的社会效益。

Abstract: Shortlisting is the process of selecting a subset of alternatives from a larger pool for further consideration or final decision-making. It is widely applied in social choice and multi-agent system scenarios. The growing demand for participatory decision-making and the continuously expanding space of candidates create an urgent need for efficient and fair shortlisting procedures. However, little principled study has been done on this problem. This blue-sky paper aims to highlight the overlooked significance of shortlisting, distinguish it from related problems, provide initial thoughts, and, more importantly, serve as a call to arms. We envision that principled shortlisting can reduce cognitive burden, enable fair collective decisions, encourage broader participation, and ultimately build trust in democratic systems.

### [7] [Alliance Mechanisms in General Lotto Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21319)
*Vade Shah,Jason R. Marden*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文分析了在联盟博弈中三种联盟机制的不同效果，发现它们在集体改进上等效，但在相互改进上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同联盟机制在资源竞争模型中的效果，以探索联盟形成的最优策略。

Method: 通过分析三种联盟机制（资源捐赠、竞争重新分配及两者结合）在联盟博弈中的表现，比较其效果。

Result: 研究显示，三种机制在集体改进上等效，但在相互改进上表现不同：资源捐赠和竞争重新分配仅在有限游戏实例中有效，而结合机制在几乎所有实例中有效。

Conclusion: 联盟机制的差异取决于联盟的目标，集体改进目标下机制等效，而相互改进目标下结合机制最有效。

Abstract: How do different alliance mechanisms compare? In this work, we analyze various methods of forming an alliance in the Coalitional General Lotto game, a simple model of competitive resource allocation. In the game, Players 1 and 2 independently compete against a common Adversary by allocating their limited resource budgets towards separate sets of contests; an agent wins a contest by allocating more resources towards it than their opponent. In this setting, we study three alliance mechanisms: budget transfers (resource donation), contest transfers (contest redistribution), and joint transfers (both simultaneously). For all three mechanisms, we study when they present opportunities for collective improvement (the sum of the Players' payoffs increases) or mutual improvement (both Players' individual payoffs increase). In our first result, we show that all three are fundamentally different with regards to mutual improvement; in particular, mutually beneficial budget and contest transfers exist in distinct, limited subsets of games, whereas mutually beneficial joint transfers exist in almost all games. However, in our second result, we demonstrate that all three mechanisms are equivalent when it comes to collective improvement; that is, collectively beneficial budget, contest, and joint transfers exist in almost all game instances, and all three mechanisms achieve the same maximum collective payoff. Together, these results demonstrate that differences between mechanisms depend fundamentally on the objective of the alliance.
