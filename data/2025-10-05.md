### [1] [MPMAvatar: Learning 3D Gaussian Avatars with Accurate and Robust Physics-Based Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01619)
*Changmin Lee,Jihyun Lee,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MPMAvatar是一个框架，用于从多视角视频创建3D人类头像，支持高度逼真、稳健的动画以及自由视角的逼真渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管3D头像创建领域取得了显著进展，但为松散衣物的人类建模物理合理的动态仍是一个挑战性问题。现有工作虽然利用了物理模拟，但在准确性和对新动画输入的鲁棒性方面存在局限。

Method: MPMAvatar使用基于Material Point Method的模拟器，结合各向异性本构模型和新型碰撞处理算法，精确建模衣物复杂变形和与身体接触的动态。此外，还结合了可渲染的高斯飞溅技术，实现高保真渲染。

Result: 实验表明，MPMAvatar在动态建模准确性、渲染准确性以及鲁棒性和效率方面显著优于现有基于物理的头像方法，并能泛化到未见过的零样本交互场景。

Conclusion: MPMAvatar通过结合先进的物理模拟与高保真渲染技术，显著提升了3D头像的动态逼真性和泛化能力，为其在实际应用中的广泛使用奠定了基础。

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

### [2] [Multimodal Feedback for Task Guidance in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01690)
*Hu Guo,Lily Patel,Rohan Gupt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文研究结合光学透射增强现实（OST-AR）和腕部振动触觉反馈的多模态系统，以提高深度感知任务的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OST-AR系统依赖视觉叠加可能导致注意力过载，且在某些环境下（如遮挡或光照不足）限制了深度线索的感知。因此，研究者探索结合振动触觉反馈以弥补这些不足。

Method: 设计了一种带有六个振动马达的腕带，提供方向和状态提示，并将其与手持工具和OST-AR系统集成。通过一项形成性研究和两项实验（N=21和N=27）评估其效果。

Result: 多模态反馈显著提高了空间精度和可用性，用户在认知负荷下能准确识别触觉模式，表现优于纯视觉或纯触觉条件。

Conclusion: 结合OST-AR和腕部振动触觉的多模态反馈是一种有效的解决方案，能够改善任务执行效果并提升用户体验。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

### [3] [MIRAGE: Patient-Specific Mixed Reality Coaching for MRI via Depth-Only Markerless Registration and Immersive VR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01743)
*Daniel Brooks,Emily Carter,Hu Guo,Rajesh Nair*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MIRAGE利用混合现实技术降低MRI患者的焦虑，通过虚拟现实和无标记增强现实注册实现厘米级精度，提升患者体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI检查中的空间限制和噪音会引发患者焦虑和幽闭恐惧症，导致扫描失败或依赖药物镇静，亟需解决方案。

Method: 采用MIRAGE系统，结合虚拟现实和无标记增强现实注册技术，为患者提供沉浸式指导环境，并评估其临床部署可行性。

Result: 系统实现了亚厘米级的精度，显著降低患者焦虑，并获得积极的可用性评分。

Conclusion: MIRAGE系统在降低MRI患者焦虑和提高扫描成功率方面具有潜力，适合临床推广应用。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

### [4] [ROI-GS: Interest-based Local Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01978)
*Quoc-Anh Bui,Gilles Rougeron,Géraldine Morin,Simone Gasparini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROI-GS的对象感知框架，通过对象引导的相机选择、针对性对象训练以及高保真对象重建的无缝集成，显著提升了3D场景中感兴趣区域的细节质量，同时保持实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在场景中均匀分配资源，导致感兴趣区域（ROI）的细节受限且模型体积过大。本文旨在解决这一问题，通过专注于感兴趣对象的细节重建，提升模型效率和质量。

Method: ROI-GS框架采用对象引导的相机选择、针对性对象训练，以及将高保真对象重建无缝集成到全局场景中。该方法优先处理选定对象的高分辨率细节，同时确保实时性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，ROI-GS显著提升了局部质量（PSNR提升高达2.96 dB），同时将模型总体大小减少了约17%，并在单个感兴趣对象的场景中实现了更快的训练速度，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROI-GS框架成功解决了传统3DGS方法在资源分配和细节重建上的瓶颈，为3D场景重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

### [5] [Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069)
*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微表面BRDF和2D高斯泼溅的可重光照框架，解决了高光物体几何重建和光照分离的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光物体的几何重建和光照分离是一个长期存在的挑战，现有方法通常依赖简化的BRDF模型，限制了材料的精确恢复和光照保真度。

Method: 采用微表面BRDF和2D高斯泼溅的结合，通过基于扩散的先验指导优化，并采用从粗到细的环境光优化策略。

Result: 在复杂高光场景中展示了高质量的几何和材料重建能力，实现了比现有方法更真实、一致的重光照效果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了高光物体的重建和重光照质量，为神经渲染领域提供了更高效和物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

### [6] [Learning to Play Multi-Follower Bayesian Stackelberg Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01387)
*Gerson Personnat,Tao Lin,Safwan Hossain,David C. Parkes*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究多追随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈的在线学习问题，设计了在不同反馈设置下领导者的学习算法，实现了次线性后悔。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多追随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈在实际应用中广泛存在，但领导者如何在未知类型分布的情况下在线学习最优策略是一个重要问题。

Method: 设计了两种反馈设置下的学习算法：类型反馈下实现次线性后悔，行动反馈下则根据观察到的追随者行动调整策略。

Result: 在类型反馈下，实现了不随追随者数量多项式增长的后悔界；在行动反馈下，算法后悔界接近理论下界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同类型的反馈对在线学习算法的性能有显著影响，且算法在理论上接近最优性能。

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

### [7] [Designing Inferable Signaling Schemes for Bayesian Persuasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01434)
*Caleb Probine,Mustafa O. Karabag,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究贝叶斯说服中接收者从重复互动中推断信号方案的情况，分析了发送者相对于已知承诺的性能损失，并提出了两种设计可推断信号方案的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究接收者从互动中推断信号方案的贝叶斯说服场景，而非传统模型中假设接收者已知承诺的情况。

Method: 通过SGD优化发送者在推断设置下的效用，以及使用有限理性接收者模型进行优化。

Result: 发送者在说服场景中需要更多样本，SGD在低互动情况下表现最佳，有限理性模型则是灵活的设计方法。

Conclusion: SGD在安全性警报示例中表现良好，能够找到信号较少且使接收者行为更明确的方案。

Abstract: In Bayesian persuasion, an informed sender, who observes a state, commits to
a randomized signaling scheme that guides a self-interested receiver's actions.
Classical models assume the receiver knows the commitment. We, instead, study
the setting where the receiver infers the scheme from repeated interactions. We
bound the sender's performance loss relative to the known-commitment case by a
term that grows with the signal space size and shrinks as the receiver's
optimal actions become more distinct. We then lower bound the samples required
for the sender to approximately achieve their known-commitment performance in
the inference setting. We show that the sender requires more samples in
persuasion compared to the leader in a Stackelberg game, which includes
commitment but lacks signaling. Motivated by these bounds, we propose two
methods for designing inferable signaling schemes, one being stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) on the sender's inference-setting utility, and the other
being optimization with a boundedly-rational receiver model. SGD performs best
in low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and
tuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing
inferable schemes. Finally, we apply SGD to a safety alert example and show it
to find schemes that have fewer signals and make citizens' optimal actions more
distinct compared to the known-commitment case.

### [8] [Incentive Analysis of Collusion in Fair Division](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01689)
*Haoqiang Huang,Biaoshuai Tao,Mingwei Yang,Shengwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了策略性代理在公平分问题中通过操纵报告偏好获取优势的情况，定义了SGIR和GIR来衡量合谋操纵的收益，并揭示了MNW、PS和RR三种机制在合谋漏洞上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究表明真理性与标准公平标准的不可调和性，但通过激励比框架可以绕过这一限制。然而，代理群体的合谋操纵尚未被充分探索。

Method: 定义了强群体激励比（SGIR）和群体激励比（GIR）来衡量合谋操纵的收益，并分析了MNW、PS和RR三种机制的SGIR和GIR。

Result: MNW的GIR始终为2，而MNW和PS的SGIR以及PS和RR的GIR均为c+1（c≥1），RR的SGIR在c≥2时无界。

Conclusion: 揭示了MNW、PS和RR三种机制在合谋操纵下的不同脆弱性，填补了群体操纵研究的空白。

Abstract: We study fair division problems with strategic agents capable of gaining
advantages by manipulating their reported preferences. Although several
impossibility results have revealed the incompatibility of truthfulness with
standard fairness criteria, subsequent works have circumvented this limitation
through the incentive ratio framework. Previous studies demonstrate that
fundamental mechanisms like Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) and Probabilistic Serial
(PS) for divisible goods, and Round-Robin (RR) for indivisible goods achieve an
incentive ratio of $2$, implying that no individual agent can gain more than
double his truthful utility through manipulation. However, collusive
manipulation by agent groups remains unexplored.
  In this work, we define strong group incentive ratio (SGIR) and group
incentive ratio (GIR) to measure the gain of collusive manipulation, where SGIR
and GIR are respectively the maximum and minimum of the incentive ratios of
corrupted agents. Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS,
and RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size.
Moreover, for coalition size $c \geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs
of PS and RR are $c + 1$. Finally, the SGIR of RR is unbounded for coalition
size $c \geq 2$. Our results reveal fundamental differences of these three
mechanisms in their vulnerability to collusion.

### [9] [A Linear Programming Approach to Estimate the Core in Cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01766)
*J Camacho,JC Gonçalves-Dosantos,J Sánchez-Soriano*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过线性规划近似计算转移效用合作博弈核心的新算法，通过随机线性问题采样极值点，展示了方法的可扩展性和高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算转移效用合作博弈的完整核心具有较高的计算复杂度，因此需要一种可处理的近似方法。

Method: 采用随机线性问题（LPs）采样极值点的线性规划算法，分析了其收敛性和计算复杂度。

Result: 在各种博弈模型上进行广泛模拟，结果表明该方法具有可扩展性，且在核心重建方面达到高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法为转移效用合作博弈的核心近似提供了一种高效且准确的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithm to approximate the core of transferable
utility (TU) cooperative games via linear programming. Given the computational
hardness of determining the full core, our approach provides a tractable
approximation by sampling extreme points through randomized linear problems
(LPs). We analyze its convergence and computational complexity, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive simulations on various game models. Our
results show that the method is scalable and achieves high accuracy in terms of
core reconstruction.

### [10] [Multi-group Bayesian Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02078)
*Hongxing Yuan,Xuan Zhang,Chunyu Wei,Yushun Fan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了多群组贝叶斯博弈（MBGs）模型，描述了贝叶斯博弈中的群组行为，并通过提出的转换方法找到了（强）多群组贝叶斯纳什均衡（MBNE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究贝叶斯博弈中群组行为的优化策略，提出一种模型和转换方法，以解决群组内合作与非合作博弈的最优策略问题。

Method: 提出MBGs模型，并将其转换为多群组事前代理博弈（MEAG）；给出了MEAG为（强）势博弈的充要条件，并设计了寻找（强）MBNE的算法。

Result: 通过算法成功找到MBGs的（强）MBNE，并通过示例验证了结果的正确性。

Conclusion: MBGs模型及其转换方法能够有效解决群组行为在贝叶斯博弈中的最优策略问题，为相关研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a model of multi-group Bayesian games (MBGs) to describe
the group behavior in Bayesian games, and gives methods to find (strongly)
multi-group Bayesian Nash equilibria (MBNE) of this model with a proposed
transformation. MBNE represent the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the
situation where players within a group play a cooperative game, while strongly
MBNE characterize the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation
where players within a group play a noncooperative game. Firstly, we propose a
model of MBGs and give a transformation to convert any MBG into a multi-group
ex-ante agent game (MEAG) which is a normal-form game. Secondly, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for a MBG's MEAG to be (strongly) potential.
If it is (strongly) potential, all its (strongly) Nash equilibria can be found,
and then all (strongly) MBNE of the MBG can be obtained by leveraging the
transformation's good properties. Finally, we provide algorithms for finding
(strongly) MBNE of a MBG whose MEAG is (strongly) potential and use an
illustrative example to verify the correctness of our results.
