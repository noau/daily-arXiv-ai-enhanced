Synthetic Tait Computability\n(STC) provides an abstract treatment of the complex gluing models by\ninternalizing the gluing category into a modal dependent type theory with a\nphase distinction. This work presents a mechanization of STC in the Istari\nproof assistant. Istari is a Martin-L\\\"{o}f-style extensional type theory with\nequality reflection. Equality reflection eliminates the nuisance of transport\nreasoning typically found in intensional proof assistants. This work develops a\nreusable library for synthetic phase distinction, including modalities,\nextension types, and strict glue types, and applies it to two case studies: (1)\na canonicity model for dependent type theory with dependent products and\nbooleans with large elimination, and (2) a Kripke canonicity model for the\ncost-aware logical framework. Our results demonstrate that the core STC\nconstructions can be formalized essentially verbatim in Istari, preserving the\nelegance of the on-paper arguments while ensuring machine-checked correctness."}

Includes appendices\n  with proofs. 59 pages", "summary": "Control operators, such as exceptions and effect handlers, provide a means of\nrepresenting computational effects in programs abstractly and modularly. While\nmost theoretical studies have focused on multi-shot control operators, one-shot\ncontrol operators -- which restrict the use of captured continuations to at\nmost once -- are gaining attention for their balance between expressiveness and\nefficiency. This study aims to fill the gap. We present a mathematically\nrigorous comparison of the expressive power among one-shot control operators,\nincluding effect handlers, delimited continuations, and even asymmetric\ncoroutines. Following previous studies on multi-shot control operators, we\nadopt Felleisen's macro-expressiveness as our measure of expressiveness. We\nverify the folklore that one-shot effect handlers and one-shot\ndelimited-control operators can be macro-expressed by asymmetric coroutines,\nbut not vice versa. We explain why a previous informal argument fails, and how\nto revise it to make a valid macro-translation."}

We train CAFormer, a differentiable\nTransformer-based auction mechanism, to produce allocations that are\napproximately incentive-compatible under misreporting. Rather than benchmarking\nagainst existing agents, we explore the qualitative and strategic properties of\nthe learned mechanisms. Compared to oracle and heuristic allocations, our\nmethod achieves competitive revenue while offering robustness to misreporting.\nIn addition, we find that allocation patterns correlate with adversarial and\ndefensive activity, suggesting implicit alignment with operational priorities.\nOur results demonstrate the viability of auction-based planning in cyber\ndefense and highlight the interpretability benefits of RL-derived value\nstructures."}

We investigate how a coordinator can learn a\ncorrelated equilibrium in convex games where each player minimizes a convex\ncost function that depends on other players' actions, subject to convex\nconstraints without knowledge of the players' cost functions. We propose a\nlearning framework that learns an approximate correlated equilibrium by\nactively querying players' regrets, \\emph{i.e.}, the cost saved by deviating\nfrom the coordinator's recommendations. We first show that a correlated\nequilibrium in convex games corresponds to a joint action distribution over an\ninfinite joint action space that minimizes all players' regrets. To make the\nlearning problem tractable, we introduce a heuristic that selects finitely many\nrepresentative joint actions by maximizing their pairwise differences. We then\napply Bayesian optimization to learn a probability distribution over the\nselected joint actions by querying all players' regrets. The learned\ndistribution approximates a correlated equilibrium by minimizing players'\nregrets.

However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,\nproducing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and\noverfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor\nis uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without\nguidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel\nalternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification\nphases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed\nby photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low\ndensification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians\nfollowed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and\nedge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting\nby carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the\nscene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate\nthat AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency\ncompared to existing methods."}

To\nimprove accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as\nmajority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a\ndecision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the\noracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards.\nHowever, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a\nsingle user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation\nfunction and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring\nattacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed\nsystems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally\nencourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose\na new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the\nproposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only\none oracle.

Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction\nalgorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling\nlimitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied\nto synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering\ndensity, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit\nneural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a\nset of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder\nfeeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified\ndegree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,\nwhich also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture\ndirectional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model\npredicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is\nperformed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform\nintermediate images for supervision.
