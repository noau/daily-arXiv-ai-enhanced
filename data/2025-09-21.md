TL;DR: WorldForge是一种无需训练的推理时框架，通过三个紧密耦合的模块解决了视频扩散模型在3D/4D任务中的可控性和几何不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在空间智能任务中表现出强大的潜力，但其有限的可控性和几何不一致性阻碍了实际应用。

Method: WorldForge包含三个模块：Intra-Step Recursive Refinement（递归细化机制）、Flow-Gated Latent Fusion（基于光流相似性的潜在融合）和Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance（双路径自校正机制）。

Result: 实验证明，WorldForge在真实性、轨迹一致性和视觉保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WorldForge为可控视频合成提供了一种即插即用的新范式，展示了生成先验在空间智能中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

### [2] [DeliverC: Teaching Pointers through GenAI-Powered Game-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14496)
*Wyatt Petula,Anushcka Joshi,Peggy Tu,Amrutha Somasundar,Suman Saha*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一款名为DeliverC的游戏工具，集成了GPT-4-mini，用于在编程教育中提供个性化提示和动态生成与C指针相关的挑战。初步研究表明，该工具提高了学生的自信心和反思能力，但AI生成的反馈仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前游戏化学习在编程教育中广泛应用，但缺乏针对复杂主题（如C指针）的实时自适应支持工具。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了DeliverC游戏，并集成GPT-4-mini以提供个性化提示和动态生成挑战。通过25名本科生的试点研究，收集游戏数据和调查问卷，评估工具对学习的影响。

Result: 结果显示，使用该工具后，学生自信心和反思能力提升，错误率下降；但参与度随任务难度增加而降低，部分学生反馈AI生成的提示不够清晰。

Conclusion: 研究证实了DeliverC在提升系统编程学习中的潜力，但需要进一步优化AI生成的反馈，强调了生成式AI与游戏化学习结合的价值。

Abstract: While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools
offer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We
present DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide
personalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a
pilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of
the system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered
constructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback
quality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective
after using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through
scaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and
some students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings
suggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems
programming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our
study highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to
support personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging
programming domains.

### [3] [Refinement-Types Driven Development: A study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15005)
*Facundo Domínguez,Arnaud Spiwack*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文主张将SMT求解器广泛应用于日常编程中，挑战传统观点认为这些工具仅适用于形式化方法和验证。通过将SMT求解器无缝集成到编译器的静态检查中，可以显著增强普通类型检查器在程序组合中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观念，扩展SMT求解器的应用范围，使其不仅限于形式化方法和验证，而是用于日常编程任务，提升编程的简便性和乐趣。

Method: 通过将SMT求解器集成到编译器的静态检查中，并结合细化类型（如Liquid Haskell中的实现），提出了一种改进普通类型检查器的方法。并通过一个关于编译器绑定作用域的案例研究，验证了该方法。

Result: 案例研究展示了细化类型和SMT求解器如何简化普通编程任务，尤其是程序组合。此外，还开发了一个有限映射理论的Liquid Haskell求解器原型，支持了案例研究。

Conclusion: 本文展望了一个通过细化类型和SMT求解器简化并提升日常编程体验的未来。提出的方法为普通编程任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper advocates for the broader application of SMT solvers in everyday
programming, challenging the conventional wisdom that these tools are solely
for formal methods and verification. We claim that SMT solvers, when seamlessly
integrated into a compiler's static checks, significantly enhance the
capabilities of ordinary type checkers in program composition. Specifically, we
argue that refinement types, as embodied by Liquid Haskell, enable the use of
SMT solvers in mundane programming tasks. Through a case study on handling
binder scopes in compilers, we envision a future where ordinary programming is
made simpler and more enjoyable with the aid of refinement types and SMT
solvers. As a secondary contribution, we present a prototype implementation of
a theory of finite maps for Liquid Haskell's solver, developed to support our
case study.

Abstract: Understanding the formation of opinions on interconnected topics within
social networks is of significant importance. It offers insights into
collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural
Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a
weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging
process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual
minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to
an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds
on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at
equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala
(STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and
provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.
  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented
as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a
multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant
interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy
for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the
multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex
interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we
provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties.
Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that
the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity,
involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external
disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.

### [5] [Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在偏好不确定的匹配市场中，以置信参数δ和最小样本复杂度识别稳定匹配的问题，并提出了一种高效算法，在单边和双边学习设置中接近样本复杂度的理论下界。

Conclusion: 研究证明了所提算法在单边和双边学习设置中的有效性，并能接近理论下界，同时通过ODE系统阐明了算法的理论基础。

Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain
preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence
parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via
stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use
in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be
matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable
manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable
matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity
for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true
preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We
propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically
($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning.
Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the
two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it
closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system
of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.
