In this\npaper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns\nvirtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling\nboth tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both\ndirections and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and\ngarment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without\ntask-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we\nintroduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for\nrobustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that\nleverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and\ntry-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment\naccuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization."}

To address these limitations,\nwe introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm\nthat intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm\nintelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in\ncritical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible\nquality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage\nGaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate\nefficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop\na Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant\ncompression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory\nefficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed."}

This is because of the\ninherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining\ndeformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.\nOur approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian\nencoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for\nflexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that\ncompensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an\nadaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to\nefficiently query and optimize dynamic areas.

To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this\nintuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency\nof mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and\nestablish their correctness."}

Once a good\narrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be\nimmediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to\nensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.\nUnfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in\ngeneral, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.\n  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting\nalgorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction\nvector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine\nlearning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we\nmeasure their error using the total variation distance from the true\nvaluations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with\nthe true values.\n  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility\nresults even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore\npredictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both\nthe predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the\nprediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate\nEFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary\nto the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the\nnecessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with\nidentical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.\nThe algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy\nof the predictions increases."}
