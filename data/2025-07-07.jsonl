In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through\nevaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we\ndemonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional\ncorrectness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance\noverhead) is imperceptible."}

This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and\neconomically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint\noptimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state\nmachines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior\nacross adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic\nmechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on\nconvergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that\navailability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded\nepsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal\neconomic control."}

It extends Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for\nspatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation\nemerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a\nbi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints.\nConsequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff\nthresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while\nincorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers.\nTherefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative\nincentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this\nconstrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and\nevolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to\ncooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The\nframework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates.

In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based\nlighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment\nmaps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area\nlight illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.\nCrucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be\nexecuted on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is\npartitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the\ncorresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we\nobtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each\nregion. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically\nsample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian\napproximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time\napproximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material\nproperties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable\nperformance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single\ndirectional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our\napproach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment\nmap."}

An alternative approach to designing better\nauction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make\nincentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the\nbidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The\nimplementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of\nbidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study\nof the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in\nnon-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful\nauctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a\npolynomial number $\\tilde O(\\frac{n}{\\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the\nbidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of\nestimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of\nthe pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of\nbidders."}
