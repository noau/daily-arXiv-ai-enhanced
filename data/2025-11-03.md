  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代量子处理器仅支持相邻比特的交互，量子编译中的比特映射任务至关重要。现有的方法未能充分利用依赖信息，导致编译结果不够高效。

Method: 本文提出了一种新算法，通过仿射抽象建模量子电路，计算传递依赖权重，并利用这些信息分层优化量子电路的映射。

Result: 在IBM和Rigetti量子处理器上进行的测试显示，新算法在深度和SWAP门数量上显著优于四种基线工具（QMAP、Sabre、Cirq和TKET），同时保持了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于传递依赖权重的比特映射算法为量子编译提供了更高效的解决方案，显著提升了量子程序的性能。

Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical task in Quantum Compilation, as modern Quantum
Processing Units (QPUs) are constrained to nearest-neighbor interactions
defined by a qubit coupling graph. This compiler pass repairs the connectivity
of two-qubit gates whose operands are not adjacent by inserting SWAP gates that
move the state of qubits between directly connected qubits. Deciding when to
introduce SWAPs while minimizing their count is critical because the error in
quantum programs increases exponentially with the circuit latency, measured in
number of gates along the critical path of the circuit. Prior work for this
problem relied on heuristics and exact methods that partition the circuit into
two or more layers, but failed to exploit valuable dependence information in
any form.
  This paper introduces a novel qubit mapping algorithm based on the weight of
transitive dependences. The introduced mapper models quantum circuits with
affine abstractions thereby yielding the ability to compute transitive
dependences. In turn, the newfound information is used to partition circuits by
dependence distances and compute, efficiently, distinct weights for each layer.
We evaluate the efficiency of our mapper on IBM and Rigetti QPUs, using the
large datasets from the QUEKO and QASMBench benchmark suites, and against four
baseline tools (QMAP, Sabre, Cirq and TKET), demonstrating notable improvements
in circuit depth and swap count while delivering competitive scalability.

### [2] [Market Equilibria With Buying Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26891)
*Martin Loebl,Anetta Jedličková,Jakub Černý*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 将购买权嵌入Arrow-Debreu模型，研究通过购买权调控对长期不平等的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源于分配危机等需要调控干预的情境，稀缺资源倾向于集中在富裕个体中，而大众需求未满足。集中分配可能不可行，购买权提供更实用的替代方案。

Method: 建模情景中，监管者定期分发购买权以促进更公平分配。包括定义迭代市场、每轮分发和交易购买权，以及市场清算价格的近似算法。

Result: 提出了关于调控系统的上界“挫败感”，类似于无政府价格，衡量个体买家在市场分配中因不公平而产生的损失。

Conclusion: 购买权调控提供了一种可行且更易管理的方式，以减少不平等并提升分配公平性。

Abstract: We embed buying rights into a (repeated) Arrow-Debreu model to study the
long-term effects of regulation through buying rights on arising inequality.
Our motivation stems from situations that typically call for regulatory
interventions, such as rationing, namely, distribution crises in which demand
and supply are persistently misaligned. In such settings, scarce resources tend
to become increasingly concentrated among more affluent individuals, while the
needs of the broader population remain unmet. While fully centralized
distribution may be logistically or politically unfeasible, issuing buying
rights offers a more practical alternative: they can be implemented digitally,
e.g., via tokens traded on online platforms, making them significantly easier
to administer. We model a scenario in which a regulator periodically
distributes buying rights with the aim of promoting a more equitable
allocation. Our contributions include (i) the definition of the (iterated)
market where in each round the buying rights are distributed and then traded
alongside the resource, (ii) the approximation algorithm of the market-clearing
prices in every round, and (iii) the upper bound on \textit{frustration} -- a
notion conceptually similar to the Price of Anarchy, but for systems regulated
through buying rights, defined as the arising loss in fairness the individual
buyers have to take when the distribution is handled via the market.

Abstract: Predatory pricing -- where a firm strategically lowers prices to undermine
competitors -- is a contentious topic in dynamic oligopoly theory, with
scholars debating practical relevance and the existence of predatory
equilibria. Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to
capture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence
and form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit
(drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We
focus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces
the subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium
can be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not
in models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in
finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key
findings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms
reliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information
oligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the
resulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results
demonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium
strategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium
analysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study
answers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition
authorities and regulators.
