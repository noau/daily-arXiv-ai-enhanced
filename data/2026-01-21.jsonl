We investigate Temporal Envy-Freeness Up to One Good (TEF1) and Up to Any Good (TEFX), its approximation $α$-TEFX, and Temporal Maximin Share (TMMS). Motivated by known impossibilities in standard settings, we consider the model in various restricted settings and extend it by introducing scheduling.\n  Our main contributions draw the boundary between possibility and impossibility. First, regarding temporal fair division without scheduling, we prove that while constant-factor $α$-TEFX is impossible in general, a $1/2$-approximation is achievable for generalized binary valuations and identical days with two agents. Second, regarding temporal fair division with scheduling, we demonstrate that a scheduling buffer of size at least $n/2$ enables TEF1 for identical days. However, we establish that TEFX and TMMS remain largely impossible even with scheduling or restricted domains. These results highlight the inherent difficulty of strict temporal fairness and quantify the trade-offs required to achieve approximation guarantees."}

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $Σ_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items."}

The treatment of redistricting in computational social choice has essentially focused on the process of determining \"appropriate\" districts. In this work, we are interested in understanding the gamut of options left for the \"losing\" party, and so we consider the flip side of the problem: Given fixed/predetermined districts, can a given party still make their candidates win by strategically placing them in certain districts? We dub this as \"recampaigning\" to capture the intuition that a party would redirect their campaigning efforts from one district to another. We model recampaigning as a computational problem, consider natural variations of the model, and study those new models through the lens of (1) (polynomial-time many-one) interreducibilities, (2) separations/collapses (both unconditional and axiomatic-sufficient), and (3) both worst-case and parametrized complexity."}

Unlike the standard fair division model, agents may derive positive or negative utility not only from items allocated directly to them, but also from items allocated to other agents. Since exact envy-freeness cannot be guaranteed, prior work has focused on its relaxations. However, two central questions remained open: does there always exist an allocation that is envy-free up to one item (EF1), and if not, what is the optimal relaxation EF-$k$ that can always be attained?\n  We settle both questions by deriving tight asymptotic bounds on the number of items sufficient to eliminate envy. We show that for any instance with $n$ agents, an allocation that is envy-free up to $O(\\sqrt{n})$ items always exists and can be found in polynomial time, and we prove a matching $Ω(\\sqrt{n})$ lower bound showing that this result is tight even for binary valuations, which rules out the existence of EF1 allocations when agents have externalities."}

While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications."}

Arvada and Treevada perform grammar inference directly on full-length input examples, which proves inefficient for large files commonly found in such languages. While Kedavra introduces data decomposition to create shorter examples for grammar inference, its lexical analysis still relies on the original inputs.

Experimental results show that Crucio is the only method capable of successfully inferring grammars for complex programming languages (where the number of nonterminals is up to 23x greater than in prior benchmarks) within reasonable time limits. On the prior simple benchmark, Crucio achieves an average recall improvement of 1.37x and 1.19x over Treevada and Kedavra, respectively, and improves F1 scores by 1.21x and 1.13x."}

However, the true accuracy of these regret estimates remains unclear. Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost. Our method provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating incentive compatibility in deep learning based auction mechanisms and highlights the need to reassess prior performance claims in this area."}

One popular proof strategy derives valid inequalities by first proving inequalities in a labelled variant of flag algebra and then transferring them to the original unlabelled setting using the so-called downward operator. We explain this strategy in detail and highlight that its transfer mechanism relies on the notion of what we call an adjoint pair, reminiscent of Galois connections and categorical adjunctions, which appear frequently in work on automated verification and programming languages.

In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the width inference problem for FIRRTL programs. We show that, if the constraints obtained from a FIRRTL program are satisfiable, there exists a unique least solution. Based on this result, we propose a complete procedure for solving the width inference problem. We implement it in the interactive theorem prover Rocq and prove its functional correctness. From the Rocq implementation, we extract an OCaml implementation, which is the first formally verified implementation of the InferWidths pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can solve more instances than the official InferWidths pass in firtool, normally with high efficiency."}

Traditional dynamic pricing models, often relying on deterministic EV-CS pairings and network equilibrium assumptions, frequently oversimplify user behavior and lack scalability. This study proposes a stochastic, behaviorally heterogeneous dynamic pricing framework formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The upper level optimizes time-varying pricing to maximize system-wide utility, while the lower level models decentralized EV users via a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model incorporating price sensitivity, battery aging, risk attitudes, and network travel costs. Crucially, the model avoids network equilibrium constraints to enhance scalability, with congestion effects represented via queuing-theoretic approximations. To efficiently solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, a rolling-horizon approach combining the Dynamic Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis-guided Cross-Entropy Method (PSA-CEM) with the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) is implemented. A real-world case study in Clayton, Melbourne, validates the framework using 22 charging stations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially reduces queuing penalties and improves user utility compared to fixed and time-of-use pricing. The framework provides a robust, scalable tool for strategic EV charging management, balancing realism with computational efficiency."}

In this paper we show how the features of functional logic programming are useful to implement program transformations in a compact and comprehensible manner.

When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to \"almost-stable\" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility."}

The occupation measure associates program states with their expected number of visits, given the initial distribution. Based on this, we derive the notion of an occupation invariant. Such invariants are essentially dual to probabilistic martingales, the predominant technique for formal probabilistic loop analysis in the literature. A key feature of occupation invariants is that they can take the initial distribution into account and often yield a proof of positive almost sure termination as a by-product.\n  Finally, we present an automatic, template-based invariant synthesis approach for occupation invariants by encoding them as generating functions.

We validate Stainless' floating-point support on a new set of benchmarks sampled from real-world code from GitHub, showing that it can verify specifications about, e.g., ranges of output or absence of special values for most supported functions, or produce counter-examples when the specifications do not hold."}

However, KA cannot always prove equivalences between specific programs. For this purpose, one adds hypotheses to KA that encode program-specific knowledge. Traditionally, a map on regular expressions called a reduction then lets us lift decidability and completeness to these more expressive systems. Explicitly constructing such a reduction requires significant labour. Moreover, due to regularity constraints, a reduction may not exist for all combinations of expression and hypothesis.\n  We describe an automaton-based construction to mechanically derive reductions for a wide class of hypotheses. These reductions can be partial, in which case they yield partial completeness: completeness for expressions in their domain. This allows us to automatically establish the provability of more equivalences than what is covered in existing work."}
