A key\ndifficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs\ninstead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.\nType systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism\nthat refines the type environment along individual control paths based on\ndominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express\nrefinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,\ncross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better\nbalance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86If-T\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\uff08type narrowing\uff09\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002If-T\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "If-T\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982TypeScript\uff09\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6b63\u8d1f\u793a\u4f8b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff08TypeScript\u3001Flow\u3001Typed Racket\u3001mypy\u548cPyright\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0If-T\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u91cf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ec6\u5316\u8c13\u8bcd\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "If-T\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6743\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6ce8\u89e3\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for\ngrammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs\nbut not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software\ncomponent. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no\nlonger appear in the available input data are missing from the generated\ngrammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for\nthe automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input\ngenerators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether\nthey are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,\nthis work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach\nleverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms\nto overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,\nthe search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with\na single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is\nstructured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of\ninputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a\ndiverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.\nResults demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for\nextracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners\nsuch as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases\nin parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness\nof the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve\nhigh performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This\ncontribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software\nengineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar\nmining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not\nonly reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of\nthe extracted grammars.

Such models are a necessity\nsince program order is not a reliable indicator of execution order, due to\nmicroarchitectural features or compiler transformations. Concurrent\nprogramming, already a challenging task, is thus made even harder when weak\nmemory effects must be addressed. A rigorous specification of weak memory\nmodels is therefore essential to make this problem tractable for developers of\nsafety- and security-critical, low-level software.\n  In this paper we survey the field of formalisations of weak memory models,\nincluding their specification, their effects on execution, and tools and\ninference systems for reasoning about code. To assist the discussion we also\nprovide an introduction to two styles of formal representation found commonly\nin the literature (using a much simplified version of Intel's x86 as the\nexample): a step-by-step construction of traces of the system (operational\nsemantics); and with respect to relations between memory events (axiomatic\nsemantics). The survey covers some long-standing hardware features that lead to\nobservable weak behaviours, a description of historical developments in\npractice and in theory, an overview of computability and complexity results,\nand outlines current and future directions in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u6027\u6216\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6307\u793a\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5185\u5b58\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u516c\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u793a\u4f8b\uff08\u5982Intel\u7684x86\uff09\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8c03\u67e5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5f31\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u53d1\u5c55\u6982\u8ff0\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

By combining\ntraditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning\nmodels, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive\ncharacter expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.\nFor the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes\nuse of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real\ntime system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the\ncharacter rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally\nstability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a\ncommercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,\nintensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters\nvia our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be\nimplemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system\nfor creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u52a8\u753b\u6280\u672f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a71\u52a8\u903c\u771f\u76843D\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u8868\u60c5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1Faceware\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u771f\u6b63\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u903c\u771f3D\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u52a8\u753b\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\uff083D\u60c5\u611f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5546\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1Faceware\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u52a8\u753b\u5e08\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u521b\u5efa\u6240\u9700\u8868\u60c5\u3002"}}
