However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/"}

In our method, users are able to put three inputs into the system, including a semantic concept, a word, and a letter. The semantic concept will be used to change the shape of the input letter and generate the texture based on the pre-defined prompt using stable diffusion models. Our pipeline maps the texture on a text image in a way that preserves the readability of the whole output while preserving legibility. The system also provides real-time adjustments for the user to change the scale of the texture and apply it to the text image. User evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively represents semantic meaning without compromising legibility, making it a robust and innovative tool for graphic design, logo creation, and artistic typography."}

These programs offer numerous advantages, including interpretability, inter-agent transparency, and formal verifiability; additionally, they enable program equilibria, solutions that leverage the transparency of code and are inaccessible within normal-form settings. We evaluate the capabilities of leading open- and closed-weight LLMs to predict and classify program strategies and evaluate features of the approximate program equilibria reached by LLM agents in dyadic and evolutionary settings. We identify the emergence of payoff-maximizing, cooperative, and deceptive strategies, characterize the adaptation of mechanisms within these programs over repeated open-source games, and analyze their comparative evolutionary fitness. We find that open-source games serve as a viable environment to study and steer the emergence of cooperative strategy in multi-agent dilemmas."}

We analyze an $α$-approximate VCG mechanism and show that truthful reporting becomes a subgame-perfect equilibrium when the immediate penalty exceeds the incentive gap created by approximation, scaled by monitoring accuracy. To validate this result, we construct a PPO-based multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for P2P smart-grid trading, where prosumers incur penalties for bidding far from their true valuations. Across systematic experiments varying approximation accuracy, tolerance, penalty magnitude, and discounting, the learned behavior closely matches theoretical predictions. The findings demonstrate that immediate-penalty approximate VCG mechanisms provide a practical and transparent approach to sustaining truthful behavior in distributed market settings."}

Holliday", "Milan Mossé", "Chase Norman", "Eric Pacuit", "Cynthia Wang"], "title": "Stable Voting and the Splitting of Cycles", "comment": "Forthcoming in Proceedings of the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size."}

The multi-stage setting arises naturally in manufacturing pipelines and distributed computing workflows, when each job must traverse a fixed sequence of processing stages. While the classical makespan price of anarchy of $2 - \\frac{1}{m}$ has been established for sequential scheduling on identical machines, the efficiency loss in multi-stage scheduling has, to the best of our knowledge, not been previously analyzed. We assume that each task follows a greedy strategy and gets assigned to the least-loaded machine upon arrival at each stage. Notably, we observe that in multi-stage environments, greedy behavior generally does not coincide with a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We continue with analyzing the equilibrium under greedy choices, since it is logical for modeling selfish agents with limited computational power, and may also model a central scheduler performing the common least-load scheduling heuristics. Under this model, we first show that in single-stage scheduling, greedy choice again yields an exact price of anarchy of $2 - \\frac{1}{m}$. In multi-stage scheduling, we show that the completion time from one stage to the next increases by at most two times the maximum job execution time. Using this relationship, we derived the price of anarchy of multistage scheduling under greedy choices to lie within $[2 - \\frac{1}{m}, 3 - \\frac{1}{m}]$, where $m$ denote the maximum number of machines in one stage."}

We characterize all individually rational (IR) and incentive-compatible (IC) mechanisms that are immune to such spiteful behavior, showing that they take the form of threshold mechanisms with an ordering of the agents. Building on this characterization, we prove two impossibility results: under either anonymity or efficiency, any such IR and IC mechanism collapses to the null mechanism, which never allocates the item to any agent. Leveraging these findings, we partially extend our analysis to a multi-item setup. These results illuminate the challenges of auctioning items in the natural presence of other-regarding preferences."}

It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \\$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \\emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \\emph{solvency}, \\emph{revenue}, and \\emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \\emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \\$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by approximately $8\\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \\$630 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency."}
