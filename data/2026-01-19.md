### [1] [Cutting Corners on Uncertainty: Zonotope Abstractions for Stream-based Runtime Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11358)
*Bernd Finkbeiner,Martin Fränzle,Florian Kohn,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了使用zonotopes作为RLola规范在线监视的抽象域，以解决传感器误差传播带来的内存无限增长问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的传感器存在校准和测量误差，这些误差在监视器的计算中传播，可能导致最终判决失真。现有的方法（如仿射算术）虽然能精确跟踪误差，但会导致内存需求随时间无限增长。

Method: 论文提出使用zonotopes作为抽象域来捕获监视器的仿射状态，并通过近似方法实现有界内存的监视器。同时比较了不同zonotope近似策略的性能和误报率。

Result: 研究表明，zonotopes能够精确捕获监视器的仿射状态，且其近似方法能够生成一个有界内存且可靠的监视器。

Conclusion: zonotopes作为一种抽象域，能够有效地解决传感器误差传播和内存无限增长的问题，为在线监视提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Stream-based monitoring assesses the health of safety-critical systems by transforming input streams of sensor measurements into output streams that determine a verdict. These inputs are often treated as accurate representations of the physical state, although real sensors introduce calibration and measurement errors. Such errors propagate through the monitor's computations and can distort the final verdict. Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.
  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications. We demonstrate that zonotopes precisely capture the affine state of the monitor and that their over-approximation produces a sound bounded-memory monitor. We present a comparison of different zonotope over-approximation strategies in the context of runtime monitoring, evaluating their performance and false-positive rates.

*Qinlin Chen,Nairen Zhang,Jinpeng Wang,Jiacai Cui,Tian Tan,Xiaoxing Ma,Chang Xu,Jian Lu,Yue Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Qihe是首个专为Verilog设计的通用静态分析框架，填补了硬件领域缺乏类似软件静态分析框架的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件领域缺乏通用静态分析框架，限制了复杂静态分析的应用，阻碍了类似软件分析中的成就。Qihe旨在填补这一空白。

Method: Qihe提供面向分析的前端、Verilog特定中间表示（IR）以及一系列基础分析工具，关注硬件特性如位向量运算、寄存器同步和数字组件并发。

Result: Qihe成功发现9个未知漏洞、18个现有静态分析工具无法检测的错误以及16个真实硬件程序中的漏洞，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过开源Qihe，团队希望推动硬件静态分析的创新和应用，构建类似软件分析的繁荣生态系统。

Abstract: In the past decades, static analysis has thrived in software, facilitating applications in bug detection, security, and program understanding. These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.

### [3] [Non-uniformly Stable Common Independent Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11153)
*Naoyuki Kamiyama*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了拟阵广义化的稳定匹配问题，特别是有平局偏好的情况，提出了一个多项式时间算法来检查是否存在满足非均匀稳定性的公共独立集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究拟阵广义化的稳定匹配问题，特别是在偏好可能包含平局的情况下，探索是否存在满足非均匀稳定性的公共独立集。

Method: 提出了一种多项式时间算法，用于检查是否存在满足非均匀稳定性的公共独立集，该算法是超稳定性和强稳定性的共同广义化。

Result: 算法能够在多项式时间内解决这一问题，验证了在该广义化背景下非均匀稳定性问题的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文成功地将稳定匹配问题扩展到拟阵广义化背景下，并提供了解决该问题的有效算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a matroid generalization of the stable matching problem. In particular, we consider the setting where preferences may contain ties. For this generalization, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of checking the existence of a common independent set satisfying non-uniform stability, which is a common generalization of super-stability and strong stability.

### [4] [Institutional AI: Governing LLM Collusion in Multi-Agent Cournot Markets via Public Governance Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11369)
*Marcantonio Bracale Syrnikov,Federico Pierucci,Marcello Galisai,Matteo Prandi,Piercosma Bisconti,Francesco Giarrusso,Olga Sorokoletova,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为“Institutional AI”的系统级AI对齐框架，通过机制设计而非偏好工程来减少多智能体LLM集成的社会危害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM集成可能协调形成社会危害性行为，当前的对齐方法（如偏好工程）效果不佳，需要一种更系统的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出治理图（governance graph）作为公开不变的清单，定义合法状态、过渡、制裁和恢复路径，并通过Oracle/Controller运行时执行治理规则，记录加密的治理日志。

Result: 在Cournot合谋案例中，Institutional体制显著减少了合谋行为（平均等级从3.1降至1.8，严重合谋发生率从50%降至5.6%），而仅靠提示的Constitutional体制则无显著效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将多智能体对齐问题视为制度设计问题，并利用治理图作为抽象工具，可能是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.

### [5] [Minimizing the Cost of EFx Allocations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11372)
*Eva Deltl*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了最小成本-EFx分配问题，旨在计算既满足EFx公平性又具有最小成本的分配方案。作者证明了该问题在两种代理情况下已经是NP难的，但也展示了在某些限制条件下具有多项式核的可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源分配中确保公平性同时限制成本是一个重要挑战，但现有研究要么专注于成本最小化而无视公平性，要么专注于公平性而无视成本。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 论文引入了最小成本-EFx分配问题，并通过算法复杂性分析证明其NP难性。此外，研究了参数限制情况下的可行性以及成本近似问题。

Result: 研究显示该问题在两代理情况下是NP难的，但在某些参数限制下具有多项式核。此外，某些特定成本模型下可实现更好的近似保障。

Conclusion: 最小成本-EFx分配问题在一般情况下是不可行的，但在特定限制条件下存在可行解或近似解。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness while limiting costs, such as transportation or storage, is an important challenge in resource allocation, yet most work has focused on cost minimization without fairness or fairness without explicit cost considerations. We introduce and formally define the minCost-EFx Allocation problem, where the objective is to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to any item (EFx) and has minimum cost. We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $ρ>1$ the problem is not $ρ$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.

### [6] [New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414)

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的自适应机制，通过双Actor-Critic（DAC）模型增强ALNS算法的适应性，考虑了销毁和修复操作符之间的交互作用，并通过图神经网络提取关键特征，显著提高了算法的效率和可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的ALNS自适应机制在选择销毁和修复操作符时未考虑它们之间的交互作用，限制了算法的适应性。本研究旨在克服这一限制，提出一种新的自适应机制。

Method: 提出的DAC-ALNS算法将销毁和修复过程建模为独立的马尔可夫决策过程，使用双Actor-Critic模型调整操作符权重，并通过图神经网络提取和归一化问题实例的关键特征。

Result: 实验证明，DAC-ALNS算法显著提高了求解效率，并表现出优异的可转移性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的DAC-ALNS机制有效提升了ALNS算法的适应性和效率，尤其在处理不同规模和特性的问题时表现突出。

Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.

### [7] [The Poisoned Apple Effect: Strategic Manipulation of Mediated Markets via Technology Expansion of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11496)
*Eilam Shapira,Roi Reichart,Moshe Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究表明，AI代理在经济市场中的集成会显著改变战略互动的格局，影响均衡收益和监管结果，甚至引发所谓的“毒苹果”效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在经济市场中引入更多AI代理技术如何影响战略互动的动态，尤其是对资源分配、信息不对称交易和信息传播的影响。

Method: 通过三种经典的博弈论场景（讨价还价、谈判和说服）分析技术扩展的经济影响。

Result: 研究发现，增加AI代理选择会显著改变均衡收益和监管结果，并揭示了“毒苹果”效应，即代理通过技术发布操纵市场设计。

Conclusion: 静态监管框架易受技术扩展的操纵，需要动态市场设计以适应AI能力的不断演变。

Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.
