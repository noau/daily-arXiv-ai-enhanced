Risk-averse quantal-response equilibrium (RQE) is a solution\nconcept that incorporates these features, providing a more realistic depiction\nof human decision making in various strategic environments compared to a Nash\nequilibrium. Furthermore a class of RQE has recently been shown in\narXiv:2406.14156 to be universally computationally tractable in all\nfinite-horizon Markov games, allowing for the development of multi-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper,\nwe expand upon the study of RQE and analyze their computation in both\ntwo-player normal form games and discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. For\nnormal form games we adopt a monotonicity-based approach allowing us to\ngeneralize previous results. We first show uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity\nof RQE with respect to player's payoff matrices under monotonicity assumptions,\nand then provide conditions on the players' degrees of risk aversion and\nbounded rationality that ensure monotonicity. We then focus on discounted\ninfinite-horizon Markov games. We define the risk-averse quantal-response\nBellman operator and prove its contraction under further conditions on the\nplayers' risk-aversion, bounded rationality, and temporal discounting. This\nyields a Q-learning based algorithm with convergence guarantees for all\ninfinite-horizon general-sum Markov games."}

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box."}

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process.

We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning\nframework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces\ncontext-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned\nheuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers\nof human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,\nand Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the\nscene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM\nreasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs\nonline validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness\nto scene dynamics.
