Traditional approaches often rely on volumetric representations guided by generative models, but these methods require extensive volumetric rendering queries, leading to slow training. Alternatively, surface-based representations offer faster optimization through differentiable rasterization, yet they are typically limited by vertex count, restricting mesh resolution and scalability when combined with generative priors. Moreover, integrating generative priors into physically based human avatar modeling remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DIS (Deep Inverse Shading), a unified framework for high-fidelity, relightable avatar reconstruction that incorporates generative priors into a coherent surface representation. DIS centers on a mesh-based model that serves as the target for optimizing both surface and material details. The framework fuses multi-view 2D generative surface normal predictions, rich in detail but often inconsistent, into the central mesh using a normal conversion module. This module converts generative normal outputs into per-triangle surface offsets via differentiable rasterization, enabling the capture of fine geometric details beyond sparse vertex limitations. Additionally, DIS integrates a de-shading module to recover accurate material properties. This module refines albedo predictions by removing baked-in shading and back-propagates reconstruction errors to optimize the geometry. Through joint optimization of geometry and material appearance, DIS achieves physically consistent, high-quality reconstructions suitable for accurate relighting. Our experiments show that DIS delivers SOTA relighting quality, enhanced rendering efficiency, lower memory consumption, and detailed surface reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIS\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u9006\u5411\u7740\u8272\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u6216\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u6216\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "DIS\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u7ebf\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53bb\u7740\u8272\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "DIS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4f4e\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "DIS\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability.

In our setting, the centralized allocator is interested in ensuring the allocation is fair among the groups and between agents. This setting applies to many real-world scenarios, including when a school administrator wants to allocate resources (e.g., office spaces and supplies) to staff members in departments and when a city council allocates limited housing units to various families in need across different communities. To ensure fair allocation between agents, we consider the classical envy-freeness (EF) notion. To ensure fairness among the groups, we define the notion of centralized group equitability (CGEQ) to capture the fairness for the groups from the allocator's perspective. Because an EF or CGEQ allocation does not always exist in general, we consider their corresponding natural relaxations of envy-freeness to one item (EF1) and centralized group equitability up to one item (CGEQ1). For different classes of valuation functions of the agents and the centralized allocator, we show that allocations satisfying both EF1 and CGEQ1 always exist and design efficient algorithms to compute these allocations.

Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games.

However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time.

For instance, an $(O(n^2))$ versus $(O(n \\log n))$ sorting algorithm may yield similar output but incur vastly different performance costs in production. This discrepancy reveals a critical limitation in current evaluation methods: they fail to capture the behavioral and performance diversity among correct solutions. To address this, we introduce a principled framework for evaluating the dynamic stability of generated code. We propose two metrics derived from opcode distributions: Static Canonical Trace Divergence (SCTD), which captures algorithmic structure diversity across generated solutions, and Dynamic Canonical Trace Divergence (DCTD), which quantifies runtime behavioral variance. Their ratio, the Behavioral Expression Factor (BEF), serves as a diagnostic signal: it indicates critical runtime instability when BEF $\\ll$ 1 and functional redundancy when BEF $\\gg$ 1. Empirical results on BigOBench and CodeContests show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant algorithmic variance even among functionally correct outputs. Notably, increasing sampling temperature improves pass@1 rates but degrades stability, revealing an unrecognized trade-off: searching for correct solutions in diverse output spaces introduces a \"penalty of instability\" between correctness and behavioral consistency.

In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "STeP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u72b6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7a0b\u62bd\u8c61\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STeP\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "STeP\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u72b6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7387\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u5206\u590d\u7528\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5178\u578bLLM\u5c42\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u7247\u4e0a\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c422.18\u500d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf1.5\u500d\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u5206\u590d\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u73872.57\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u62bd\u8c61\u3002"}}
