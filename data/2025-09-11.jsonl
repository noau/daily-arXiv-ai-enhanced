Taking a game-theoretic perspective, we initialize the study of\n\\emph{budget-aggregation games} where each agent has virtual decision power\nover some fraction of the budget. This paper investigates the structure and\nshows efficient computability of Nash equilibria in this setting for various\npreference models. In particular, we show that Nash equilibria for Leontief\nutilities can be found in polynomial time, solving an open problem from Brandt\net al. [2023]."}

However, existing\npart-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer\nfrom poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce\nX-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D\nobject into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high\ngeometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part\ngeneration and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful\ndecomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part\ngeneration. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work\nestablishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and\nstructurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research."}

We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that\nunifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over\nlattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction\nloops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order\nand prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points\n(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware\ncontraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of\niterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars\n(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees\nwell-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer\nhuman-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,\nincluding multi-pass \"plan $\\to$ verify $\\to$ revise\" routines and agentic tool\nuse. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent\nadvances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic\nprompting."}
