In representation theory, it is interesting because\nit naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of\npersistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of\ncentral subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to\nunderstand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a\nclass of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a\nfull subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its\ncorresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint\nquadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the\ncontraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction\nfunctor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an\nadjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we\nintroduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems,\nand prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve\ninterval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval\ncovers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions\nfor certain classes of finite posets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms.

The model is\ntrained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to\nstabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation.

Our approach incorporates\ngeometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.\nAdditionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances\nthe generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting\nin smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother\ntransitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally\nstable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nVideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and\nstability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both\nvisual quality and temporal coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoTex\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b33D\u7eb9\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u548cUV\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f0fUV\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u53163D\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVideoTex\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u63a5\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoTex\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
