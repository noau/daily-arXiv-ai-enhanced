The method integrates RGB,\ndepth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.\nSpecifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP\n(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,\nallowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better\ndistinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic\nmodeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of\nprecision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.\nExperiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that\nPreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while\nmaintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability."}

However, these methods involve a workflow of converting\nvector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then\nconverting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and\nredundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector\ndata, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for\nboundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector\nspace. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization\ntrajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This\nenables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of\nthe predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout\ndesign, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative\ncomparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual\nstudies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor\nplans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability\nto users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground\ntruths."}

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:\nhttp://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/"}

In\nthis paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence\nof the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting\ntheir content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion\ndynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the\nprobability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy\nwhere clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.\nWe analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these\npolicies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion\ndrifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected\nutility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy.

Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect\nto an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining --\nrespectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates\nprocesses p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction\nprocesses p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar.

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each\nbenefits equally from the participation of the other."}
