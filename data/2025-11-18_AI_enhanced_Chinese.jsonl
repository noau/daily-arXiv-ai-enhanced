The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our work are demonstrated by extensive experiments using testing data, architectural surfaces, and general 3D shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u65b9\u5411\u573a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u65b9\u5411\u573a\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u65b9\u5411\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7b14\u753b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5171\u8f6d\u65b9\u5411\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u66f2\u9762\u548c\u4e00\u822c3D\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints. To effectively optimize TR-Gaussians, we develop a multi-stage optimization framework incorporating color and geometry constraints and an opacity perturbation mechanism.

Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp.

The tension between these two mindsets makes modular programming error prone. Functions that encapsulate collective operations, despite being called per-thread, must be executed cooperatively by groups of threads.\n  In this work, we introduce Prism, a new GPU language that restores modularity while still giving programmers the low-level control over collective operations necessary for high performance. Our core idea is typed perspectives, which materialize, at the type level, the granularity at which the programmer is controlling the behavior of threads. We describe the design of Prism, implement a compiler for it, and lay its theoretical foundations in a core calculus called Bundl.

Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. While the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism achieves efficient and truthful outcomes, it is highly vulnerable to collusion. In contrast, fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We then propose a Hybrid VCG (H-VCG) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders, assuming access to a black-box collusion detection algorithm. We show that H-VCG is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that H-VCG consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness. Our results provide a principled framework for incorporating collusion detection into mechanism design, offering a step toward collusion-resistant auctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u4e32\u8c0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408VCG\u673a\u5236\uff08H-VCG\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u4e32\u8c0b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u7684VCG\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e32\u8c0b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u798f\u5229\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7684VCG\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u4e32\u8c0b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u9632\u6b62\u4e32\u8c0b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53c8\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5e94\u4ed8\u4e32\u8c0b\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u826f\u597d\u798f\u5229\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e32\u8c0b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u5728VCG\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408VCG\u673a\u5236\uff08H-VCG\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VCG\u673a\u5236\u548c\u975e\u4e32\u8c0b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "H-VCG\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u4e32\u8c0b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u7684VCG\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u798f\u5229\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684VCG\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "H-VCG\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e32\u8c0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u6297\u4e32\u8c0b\u62cd\u5356\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

We present a set of synthesis rules, based on a denotational semantics of generators, that give rise to an automatic procedure for synthesizing correct generators. Our system handles recursive predicates by rewriting them as catamorphisms and then matching with appropriate anamorphisms; this is theoretically simpler than other approaches to synthesis for recursive functions, yet still extremely expressive.\n  Our implementation, Palamedes, is an extensible library for the Lean theorem prover.

The goal is to find a core-stable allocation that exhausts all mutually beneficial exchanges among subgroups of agents. While this model has been extensively studied in economics and computer science due to its broad applications, little attention has been paid to settings where preferences are unknown and must be learned through repeated interactions. In this paper, we propose a statistical learning model within the multi-player multi-armed bandit framework, where players (agents) learn their preferences over arms (goods) from stochastic rewards. We introduce the notion of core regret for each player as the market objective. We study both centralized and decentralized approaches, proving $O(N \\log T / \u0394^2)$ upper bounds on regret, where $N$ is the number of players, $T$ is the time horizon and $\u0394$ is the minimum preference gap among players. For the decentralized setting, we also establish a matching lower bound, demonstrating that our algorithm is order-optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u504f\u597d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u504f\u597d\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9057\u61be\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a$O(N \\log T / \\Delta^2)$\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}

Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training.

Our method reduces failure rates by 30-55% at matched cost and scales to thousands of agents with near-linear runtime, while preserving feasibility with high probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u6563\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u961f\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u5730\u5206\u914d\u7a00\u7f3a\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u5145\u7535\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6563\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5171\u8bc6-ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\u4e0a\u534f\u8c03\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u8def\u7f51\u548c\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e30-55%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u3002"}}
