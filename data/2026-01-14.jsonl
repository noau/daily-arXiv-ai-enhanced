Against this background, blendshapes have become a common industry animation solution because of their relative simplicity and ease of interpretation. Aiming for real-time performance and low computing resource dependence, we independently developed an accurate blendshape prediction system for low-power VR applications using a standard webcam. First, blendshape feature vectors are extracted through affine transformation and segmentation. Through further transformation and regression analysis, we were able to identify models for most blendshapes with significant predictive power. Post-processing was used to further improve response stability, including smoothing filtering and nonlinear transformations to minimize error. Experiments showed the system achieved accuracy similar to ARKit 6. Our model has low sensor/hardware requirements and realtime response with a consistent, accurate and smooth visual experience."}

Sources: https://github.com/tweag/tbagrel-phd-manuscript/", "summary": "Destination-passing style programming introduces destinations, which represent the address of a write-once memory cell. These destinations can be passed as function parameters, allowing the caller to control memory management: the callee simply fills the cell instead of allocating space for a return value. While typically used in systems programming, destination passing also has applications in pure functional programming, where it enables programs that were previously unexpressible using usual immutable data structures.\n  In this thesis, we develop a core λ-calculus with destinations, {λ_d}. Our new calculus is more expressive than similar existing systems, with destination passing designed to be as flexible as possible. This is achieved through a modal type system combining linear types with a system of ages to manage scopes, in order to make destination-passing safe. Type safety of our core calculus was proved formally with the Coq proof assistant.\n  Then, we see how this core calculus can be adapted into an existing pure functional language, Haskell, whose type system is less powerful than our custom theoretical one. Retaining safety comes at the cost of removing some flexibility in the handling of destinations. We later refine the implementation to recover much of this flexibility, at the cost of increased user complexity.\n  The prototype implementation in Haskell shows encouraging results for adopting destination-passing style programming when traversing or mapping over large data structures such as lists or data trees."}

Given two instances $A$ and $B$ on the same set of agents, a matching is said to be robust if it is stable under both instances. This notion captures desirable robustness properties in matching markets where preferences may evolve, be misreported, or be subject to uncertainty. While the classical theory of stable matchings reveals rich lattice, algorithmic, and polyhedral structure for a single instance, it is unclear which of these properties persist when stability is required across multiple instances. Our work initiates a systematic study of the structural and computational behavior of robust stable matchings under increasingly general models of preference changes.\n  We analyze robustness under a hierarchy of perturbation models:\n  1. a single upward shift in one agent's preference list,\n  2. an arbitrary permutation change by a single agent, and\n  3. arbitrary preference changes by multiple agents on both sides.\n  For each regime, we characterize when:\n  1. the set of robust stable matchings forms a sublattice,\n  2. the lattice of robust stable matchings admits a succinct Birkhoff partial order enabling efficient enumeration,\n  3. worker-optimal and firm-optimal robust stable matchings can be computed efficiently, and\n  4. the robust stable matching polytope is integral (by studying its LP formulation).\n  We provide explicit counterexamples demonstrating where these structural and geometric properties break down, and complement these results with XP-time algorithms running in $O(n^k)$ time, parameterized by $k$, the number of agents whose preferences change. Our results precisely delineate the boundary between tractable and intractable cases for robust stable matchings."}

Given a tournament digraph $D$, which encodes the outcomes of all possible matches, and a designated player $v^* \\in V(D)$, the \\textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem (TFP) asks whether the tournament can be scheduled in a way that guarantees $v^*$ emerges as the winner. TFP is known to be NP-hard, but is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by structural measures such as the feedback arc set (fas) or feedback vertex set (fvs) number of the tournament digraph. In this paper, we introduce and study two new structural parameters: the number of players who can defeat $v^*$ (i.e., the in-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $k$) and the number of players that $v^*$ can defeat (i.e., the out-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $\\ell$).\n  A natural question is that: can TFP be efficiently solved when $k$ or $\\ell$ is small? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that TFP is FPT when parameterized by either the in-degree or out-degree of $v^*$. Our algorithm for the in-degree parameterization is particularly involved and technically intricate. Notably, the in-degree $k$ can remain small even when other structural parameters, such as fas or fvs, are large. Hence, our results offer a new perspective and significantly broaden the parameterized algorithmic understanding of the \\textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem."}

We model this question using a game-theoretic version of Schelling's bounded neighbourhood model, where agents choose neighbourhoods based on concave, non-monotonic utility functions reflecting local population. While naive improvements may worsen outcomes - analogous to Braess' paradox - we show that carefully designed, small-scale investments can reliably align individual incentives with societal goals. Specifically, modifying utilities at a total cost of at most $0.81 ε^2 \\cdot \\texttt{opt}$ guarantees that every resulting Nash equilibrium achieves a social welfare of at least $ε\\cdot \\texttt{opt}$, where $\\texttt{opt}$ is the optimum social welfare. Our results formalise how targeted interventions can transform supra-negative outcomes into supra-positive returns, offering new insights into strategic urban planning and decentralised collective behaviour."}
