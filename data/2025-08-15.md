Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(mLLMs)在许多图像和图形任务中表现出色，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限。本文旨在探索mLLMs是否能适应B-rep CAD对象的编辑任务，解决缺乏标注数据和3D表示特性的问题。

Result: B-repLer能够理解文本提示并对给定的B-reps进行语义编辑，生成有效的输出。实验展示了多种复杂度的文本驱动的B-rep编辑，这是之前无法实现的。

Conclusion: B-repLer的提出填补了mLLMs在3D编辑任务中的空白，展示了其在处理B-rep CAD对象中的潜力，无需依赖外部标注数据。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

### [2] [Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781)
*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动生成任意量子架构的量子位映射和路由（QMR）编译器的方法，通过定义通用核心结构（设备状态机）和领域特定语言Marol，解决了量子计算中多样架构的编译问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算机在材料科学和化学等领域有巨大潜力，但量子架构的多样性和快速演变使得QMR问题变得复杂。需要一个通用方法来自动生成适用于不同架构的编译器。

Method: 通过识别QMR问题的通用核心结构（设备状态机），提出了领域特定语言Marol，用于定义QMR问题。使用参数化求解器解决Marol定义的QMR问题。

Result: 通过案例研究表明，生成的编译器在运行时和解质量上与手工编写的专用编译器相当，适用于噪声和容错量子架构。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了未来量子编译器的开发，为新兴量子架构提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

### [3] [FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129)
*Jiehua Chen,Sanjukta Roy,Sofia Simola*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了与稳定匹配相关的三个优化问题的参数化可近似性，包括最小化阻塞对数的问题和最大化稳定匹配大小的问题，并展示了它们的计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稳定匹配问题的参数化可近似性，特别是针对最小化阻塞对数和最大化稳定匹配大小的问题，以理解它们的计算复杂性和可能的近似算法。

Method: 通过分析三个优化问题的计算复杂性，使用参数化复杂性理论证明它们在某些参数下的W[1]-硬性，并展示了近似算法的限制。

Result: 证明了前两个问题（Min-BP-SMI和Min-BP-SRI）在参数β下无法近似到任意函数，最后一个问题（Max-SMTI）在参数“有联系的代理数量”下存在FPT近似方案。

Conclusion: 除非FPT=W[1]，否则前两个问题不存在基于参数β的FPT近似方案，而最后一个问题在特定参数下具有有效的FPT近似方案。

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在对抗环境中优化物流路径规划的游戏论模型，通过引入计算随机性和双Oracle框架，实现了难以预测且快速部署的路径计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗环境中，传统的确定性路径规划容易受到预测和干扰，限制了其有效性。因此，需要一种更难以预测且能够快速部署的路径规划方法。

Result: 该方法在现实场景中表现出色，能够扩展到实际问题规模，并通过消融研究和基准对比证明其优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过明确的对抗模型和计算随机性，该方法为对抗环境中的路径规划提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested
environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen
route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal
routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans
are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit
their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the
route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately
deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although
solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle
framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,
making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is
modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We
evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively
to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling
the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept
both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and
electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic
voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models.
However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a
carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the
computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even
approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more
players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from
poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or
lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose
a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial
complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial
branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative
analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show
the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of
computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.
