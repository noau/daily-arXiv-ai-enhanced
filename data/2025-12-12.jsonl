By considering coalgebras over categories of suitably indexed families, the correctness of the corresponding algorithms follows intrinsically just from the type of the computed maps. However, proving recursivity of the underlying coalgebras is non-trivial, and proofs are typically ad hoc. This layer of complexity impedes the formalization of coalgebraically defined recursive algorithms in proof assistants. We introduce a framework for constructing coalgebras which are intrinsically recursive in the sense that the type of the coalgebra guarantees recursivity from the outset. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a well-founded functor on a category of families indexed by a well-founded relation. We show as our main result that every coalgebra for a well-founded functor is recursive, and demonstrate that well-known techniques for proving recursivity and termination such as ranking functions are subsumed by this abstract setup. We present a number of case studies, including Quicksort, the Euclidian algorithm, and CYK parsing. Both the main theoretical result and selected case studies have been formalized in Cubical Agda."}

A generic abstract interpretation framework is not truly flexible if it does not allow interpreting with different path- and flow-sensitivities, by going forwards or backwards, and over- or under-approximately. Most interpreters inherently intertwine syntax and semantics, making the implementation antagonistic to modularity. Current approaches to modular designs require the use of complex data structures (e.g., monad transformers), providing modularity but often proving unwieldy (e.g., lifts). We observe that leveraging scoped effects within an interpreter facilitates the accumulation of semantic fragments against a fixed syntax. In this paper, we define cumulative abstract semantics, illustrating the potential for creating multiple dynamic evaluators and static analyses from one interpreter. This modularity is achieved by grouping effects into two categories: syntax elimination and domain-semantic introduction handlers. Our contribution shows the benefits of using effects as an instrument for designing a clean, elegant, and modular abstract interpretation framework."}

Theory and Evidence from Layer-2 Transactions", "comment": null, "summary": "Maximal extractable value opportunities often induce spam in Layer-2 blockchains: many identical transactions are submitted near simultaneously, most of which revert, wasting blockspace. We study Timeboost, a mechanism on Arbitrum that auctions a timestamp advantage, crucial under first-come first-served sequencing rules. We develop a game-theoretic model in which users choose the number of transaction copies to submit, and extend upon the baseline setting by modeling the Timeboost auction and subsequent transaction submission behavior. We show that Timeboost reduces spam and increases sequencer/DAO revenue in equilibrium relative to the baseline, transferring user payments from revert costs to auction bids. Empirically, we assemble mempool data from multiple Layer-2 networks, measuring spam via identical transactions submitted in narrow time intervals, and conduct an event study around Timeboost adoption on Arbitrum using other L2s as contemporaneous benchmarks. We find a decline in MEV-related spam and an increase in revenue on Arbitrum post-adoption, consistent with model predictions."}

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities."}

The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability."}

By anchoring splats to a deformable template mesh, our method overcomes topological inconsistencies and enhances editing flexibility, addressing limitations of prior Gaussian Splatting methods that treat points independently. The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions. Experiments demonstrate that DeMapGS achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality and enables downstream applications for Gaussian splats such as editing and cross-object manipulation through a shared parametric surface."}

In concave games, where players' strategy sets are compact and convex, and their payoffs are concave in their own actions, strong guarantees follow: Nash equilibria always exist and decentralized algorithms converge to equilibria. If the game is furthermore monotone, an even stronger guarantee holds: Nash equilibria are unique under strictness assumptions. Unfortunately, we show that certifying concavity or monotonicity is NP-hard, already for games where utilities are multivariate polynomials and compact, convex basic semialgebraic strategy sets -- an expressive class that captures extensive-form games with imperfect recall. On the positive side, we develop two hierarchies of sum-of-squares programs that certify concavity and monotonicity of a given game, and each level of the hierarchies can be solved in polynomial time. We show that almost all concave/monotone games are certified at some finite level of the hierarchies. Subsequently, we introduce SOS-concave/monotone games, which globally approximate concave/monotone games, and show that for any given game we can compute the closest SOS-concave/monotone game in polynomial time. Finally, we apply our techniques to canonical examples of imperfect recall extensive-form games."}

However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties."}

We study such an auction with one player having access to perfect information against straightforward bidders. When the opponents' valuations satisfy the ordinary substitutes condition, we show that it is optimal to bid on a fixed lot overtime. In this setting, we consider a continuous-time version of the SCA auction in which the prices follow a differential inclusion with a piecewise-constant dynamics. We show that there exists a unique solution in the sense of Filippov. This guarantees that the continuous-time model coincides with the limit of the discrete-time auction when price increments tend to zero. Moreover, we show that the value function of this limit auction is piecewise linear (though possibly discontinuous). Finally, we illustrate these results by analyzing a simplified version of the multiband Australian spectrum auction of 2017."}

Narayan", "Yuang Eric Shen"], "title": "Designing Truthful Mechanisms for Asymptotic Fair Division", "comment": "34 pages. To appear at AAAI 2026", "summary": "We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of $m$ goods among $n$ agents in the asymptotic setting, where each item's value for each agent is drawn from an underlying joint distribution. Prior works have shown that if this distribution is well-behaved, then an envy-free allocation exists with high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$ [Dickerson et al., 2014]. Under the stronger assumption that item values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across agents, this requirement improves to $m=Ω(n\\log{n}/\\log{\\log{n}})$, which is tight [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2021]. However, these results rely on non-strategyproof mechanisms, such as maximum-welfare allocation or the round-robin algorithm, limiting their applicability in settings with strategic agents.\n  In this work, we extend the theory to a broader, more realistic class of joint value distributions, allowing for correlations among agents, atomicity, and unequal probabilities of having the highest value for an item. We show that envy-free allocations continue to exist with a high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$. More importantly, we give a new randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation, efficiently implementable in polynomial time, and outputs envy-free allocations with high probability, answering an open question posed by [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2017]. We further extend our mechanism to settings with asymptotic weighted fair division and multiple agent types and good types, proving new results in each case."}
