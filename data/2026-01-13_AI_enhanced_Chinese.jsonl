This issue can lead to model deception, a problem that current literature has not fully solved, where the seller misrepresents model performance to earn more. We propose a game-theoretic approach, adding a verification step in the ML model market that lets buyers check model quality before buying. However, this method can be expensive and offers imperfect information, making it harder for buyers to decide. Our analysis reveals that a seller might probabilistically conduct model deception considering the chance of model verification. This deception probability decreases with the verification accuracy and increases with the verification cost. To maximize seller payoff, we further design optimal pricing schemes accounting for heterogeneous buyers' strategic behaviors. Interestingly, we find that reducing information asymmetry benefits both the seller and buyer. Meanwhile, protecting buyer order information doesn't improve the payoff for the buyer or the seller. These findings highlight the importance of reducing information asymmetry in ML model trading and open new directions for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u8ba9\u4e70\u5bb6\u5728\u8d2d\u4e70\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5356\u65b9\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5356\u65b9\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u865a\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u9ad8\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u732e\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e70\u5bb6\u5728\u8d2d\u4e70\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5356\u65b9\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u6b3a\u9a97\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u6b3a\u9a97\u6982\u7387\u3002\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u4e70\u5356\u53cc\u65b9\u5747\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e70\u5bb6\u8ba2\u5355\u4fe1\u606f\u5219\u65e0\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86Nguyen\u7b49\u4eba\uff082001\uff09\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5b9a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff08NCP\uff09\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u6563\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5747\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u7684NCP\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5f27\u7ea7NCP\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u5fae\u7684MPEC\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5148\u548cFCFS\u6392\u961f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7531\u767b\u673a\u4f18\u5148\u7ade\u4e89\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff08FCFS\uff09\u767b\u8f66\u4f18\u5148\u6743\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684NCP\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings.\n  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure.

However, our evaluation reveals a specific and consistent limitation: the model struggles to reconstruct detailed anthropometric deviations, especially on populations with special body shape alters such as geriatric muscle atrophy, scoliosis, or pregnancy, even when these features are prominent in the input image. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon not as a failure of the model's capacity, but as a byproduct of the \\textit{perception-distortion trade-off}.

In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u4e0d\u662f\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u662fNL\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u662fPSPACE\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u662fsharp-P\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u65e0\u9650\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a(i) \u8282\u70b9\u9996\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c(ii) \u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u786c\u5e01\u6295\u63b7\u5206\u914d\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u5947\u5076\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u662fNL\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff1b\u5b9a\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u662fPSPACE\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u662fsharp-P\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Existing pipelines rely on ground-truth skeletons and skinning weights for motion generation and treat auto-rigging as an independent process, undermining scalability and interpretability. We present RigMo, a unified generative framework that jointly learns rig and motion directly from raw mesh sequences, without any human-provided rig annotations. RigMo encodes per-vertex deformations into two compact latent spaces: a rig latent that decodes into explicit Gaussian bones and skinning weights, and a motion latent that produces time-varying SE(3) transformations. Together, these outputs define an animatable mesh with explicit structure and coherent motion, enabling feed-forward rig and motion inference for deformable objects. Beyond unified rig-motion discovery, we introduce a Motion-DiT model operating in RigMo's latent space and demonstrate that these structure-aware latents can naturally support downstream motion generation tasks. Experiments on DeformingThings4D, Objaverse-XL, and TrueBones demonstrate that RigMo learns smooth, interpretable, and physically plausible rigs, while achieving superior reconstruction and category-level generalization compared to existing auto-rigging and deformation baselines.

Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training. This renderability field is strongly correlated with image-space reconstruction error, naturally guiding NBV selection. We further introduce a panoramic extension that estimates omnidirectional (360$^\\circ$) view utility to accelerate candidate evaluation. In the standard indoor Replica dataset, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON achieves more uniform novel-view quality and higher 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) reconstruction accuracy than recent active GS baselines with matched view and time budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a$\backslashmathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u4f53\u7d20\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9690\u5f0f\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u573a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u89c6\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5728\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c$\backslashmathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u573a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u4f53\u7d20\u5730\u56fe\u5728\u7ebf\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u666f\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5019\u9009\u89c6\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728Replica\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c$\backslashmathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON\u5728\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u5c04\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "$\backslashmathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
