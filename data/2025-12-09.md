### [1] [Inverse Discrete Elastic Rod](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06830)
*Jiahao Li,Mingchao Liu,Haiyi Liang,HengAn Wu,Weicheng Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于优化的方法计算速度慢且边界条件限制严格，制约了弹性结构逆向设计的广泛应用。

Method: 通过将逆向问题重新表述为参考配置中的静态平衡，实现了与正向模拟相当的计算效率和保真度。

Result: 该方法通过物理原型和正向模拟验证了其准确性、鲁棒性及实际应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 逆向-DER方法为弹性结构的逆向设计提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse design of slender elastic structures underlies a wide range of applications in computer graphics, flexible electronics, biomedical devices, and soft robotics. Traditional optimization-based approaches, however, are often orders of magnitude slower than forward dynamic simulations and typically impose restrictive boundary conditions. In this work, we present an inverse discrete elastic rods (inverse-DER) method that enables efficient and accurate inverse design under general loading and boundary conditions. By reformulating the inverse problem as a static equilibrium in the reference configuration, our method attains computational efficiency comparable to forward simulations while preserving high fidelity. This framework allows rapid determination of undeformed geometries for elastic fabrication structures that naturally deform into desired target shapes upon actuation or loading. We validate the approach through both physical prototypes and forward simulations, demonstrating its accuracy, robustness, and potential for real-world design applications.

### [2] [Benchmarking Humanoid Imitation Learning with Motion Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07248)
*Zhaorui Meng,Lu Yin,Xinrui Chen,Anjun Chen,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了运动难度分数（MDS），一种独立于策略性能的度量标准，用于量化运动模仿的难度，并通过实验验证了其解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动模仿的评估指标（如关节位置误差）仅测量策略模仿的准确性，而未考虑运动本身的难度，导致无法区分失败是由于策略学习不佳还是运动本身具有挑战性。

Method: 论文提出MDS，通过刚性动力学框架定义运动难度，计算小姿态扰动引起的扭矩变化，其量化基于扭矩空间的体积、方差和时间变异性。此外，还构建了难度感知的数据集MD-AMASS。

Result: 实验验证了MDS对模仿学习策略性能的解释力，并基于MDS开发了两个新指标MID和DSJE，为模仿学习提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: MDS为运动模仿研究提供了一个独立的难度评估工具，有助于更准确地分析模仿学习的挑战性。

Abstract: Physics-based motion imitation is central to humanoid control, yet current evaluation metrics (e.g., joint position error) only measure how well a policy imitates but not how difficult the motion itself is. This conflates policy performance with motion difficulty, obscuring whether failures stem from poor learning or inherently challenging motions. In this work, we address this gap with Motion Difficulty Score (MDS), a novel metric that defines and quantifies imitation difficulty independent of policy performance. Grounded in rigid-body dynamics, MDS interprets difficulty as the torque variation induced by small pose perturbations: larger torque-to-pose variation yields flatter reward landscapes and thus higher learning difficulty. MDS captures this through three properties of the perturbation-induced torque space: volume, variance, and temporal variability. We also use it to construct MD-AMASS, a difficulty-aware repartitioning of the AMASS dataset. Empirically, we rigorously validate MDS by demonstrating its explanatory power on the performance of state-of-the-art motion imitation policies. We further demonstrate the utility of MDS through two new MDS-based metrics: Maximum Imitable Difficulty (MID) and Difficulty-Stratified Joint Error (DSJE), providing fresh insights into imitation learning.

### [3] [Human Geometry Distribution for 3D Animation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07459)
*Xiangjun Tang,Biao Zhang,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段框架，用于生成高质量的人体几何动画，通过紧凑的分布潜表示和生成式动画模型解决了有限数据下的自然衣物动态建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成逼真的人体几何动画具有挑战性，需要在有限数据下建模自然衣物动态及其精细几何细节。

Method: 方法分为两阶段：第一阶段学习一个紧凑的分布潜表示，改进SMPL与虚拟人几何之间的映射；第二阶段提出生成式动画模型，利用有限动作数据的多样性，保持长期一致性。

Result: 实验表明，潜表示生成的人体几何保真度高于之前方法（Chamfer距离降低90%），动画模型生成的动作多样性高且动态自然（用户评分提高2.2倍）。

Conclusion: 本文的两阶段框架在生成高质量人体几何动画方面表现优异，所有评估指标均达到最佳效果。

Abstract: Generating realistic human geometry animations remains a challenging task, as it requires modeling natural clothing dynamics with fine-grained geometric details under limited data. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs. First, we propose a compact distribution-based latent representation that enables efficient and high-quality geometry generation. We improve upon previous work by establishing a more uniform mapping between SMPL and avatar geometries. Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.). The animation model synthesizes diverse animations with detailed and natural dynamics ($2.2 \times$ higher user study score), achieving the best results across all evaluation metrics.

### [4] [Nice to Meet You: Synthesizing Practical MLIR Abstract Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06442)
*Xuanyu Peng,Dominic Kennedy,Yuyou Fan,Ben Greenman,John Regehr,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: NiceToMeetYou 是一个程序合成框架，用于生成抽象转换器，解决了编译器开发中抽象转换器难以实现的问题，并提供了一种新颖的分而治之的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态分析在编译过程中起着重要作用，但实现准确、高效的抽象转换器具有挑战性，甚至可能导致编译错误。此外，LLVM 等编译器仍缺乏许多指令的抽象转换器实现。

Method: NiceToMeetYou 框架利用分而治之的技术，将复杂的抽象转换器分解为多个简单的部分，并通过合成生成最终的转换器。该方法无需草图设计，并通过 SMT 验证转换器的正确性。

Result: 生成的抽象转换器都是可验证的正确性，其中17%的转换器比 LLVM 提供的更精确。

Conclusion: NiceToMeetYou 框架提供了一种自动化且可靠的方法来生成抽象转换器，填补了编译器开发中的重要空白。

Abstract: Static analyses play a fundamental role during compilation: they discover facts that are true in all executions of the code being compiled, and then these facts are used to justify optimizations and diagnostics. Each static analysis is based on a collection of abstract transformers that provide abstract semantics for the concrete instructions that make up a program. It can be challenging to implement abstract transformers that are sound, precise, and efficient, and in fact both LLVM and GCC have suffered from miscompilations caused by unsound abstract transformers. Moreover, even after more than 20 years of development, LLVM lacks abstract transformers for hundreds of instructions in its intermediate representation (IR). We developed NiceToMeetYou, a program synthesis framework for abstract transformers that are aimed at the kinds of non-relational integer abstract domains that are heavily used by today's production compilers. It exploits a simple but novel technique for breaking the synthesis problem into parts: each of our transformers is the meet of a collection of simpler, sound transformers that are synthesized such that each new piece fills a gap in the precision of the final transformer. Our design point is bulk automation: no sketches are required. Transformers are verified by lowering to a previously created SMT dialect of MLIR. Each of our synthesized transformers is provably sound and some (17 percent) are more precise than those provided by LLVM.

### [5] [PIP: Making Andersen's Points-to Analysis Sound and Practical for Incomplete C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07299)
*Håvard Rognebakke Krogstie,Helge Bahmann,Magnus Själander,Nico Reissmann*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Andersen式指向分析，能够在C语言不完整程序中实现声音性，并通过隐式指针跟踪和PIP技术显著提升速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产编译器需要高效且声音的指针分析，但传统方法需要摘要函数，而这些函数在实际中不可用。

Method: 通过隐式跟踪外部模块可访问的内存位置和指针，结合PIP技术，优化约束求解的速度和精度。

Result: 隐式指针跟踪使求解器速度提升15倍，PIP技术进一步提速1.9倍，精度提升40%，且内存占用可扩展。

Conclusion: 该分析适用于实际编译器优化，有效解决了传统方法在不完整程序中的限制。

Abstract: Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.

### [6] [Canonical bidirectional typechecking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07511)
*Zanzi Mihejevs,Jules Hedges*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文展示了双向类型检查中的可检查/可合成划分与极化System L中的对偶性一致，并结合了线性-非线性风格的扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是揭示双向类型检查与极化System L之间的对偶关系，并探索如何将其扩展到线性和非线性类型系统。

Method: 通过结合标准双向类型检查和Zeilberger的‘cocontextual’变体，以及使用Mc Bride的co-de Bruijn表示法，扩展到cartesian System L。

Result: 证明了极化System L中的正负类型划分与双向类型检查的可检查/可合成划分一致，并可扩展到线性和非线性类型系统。

Conclusion: 研究展示了极化System L、LNL演算和双向演算之间的三重巧合，为类型系统的设计提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the checkable/synthesisable split in bidirectional typechecking coincides with existing dualities in polarised System L, also known as polarised $μ\tildeμ$-calculus. Specifically, positive terms and negative coterms are checkable, and negative terms and positive coterms are synthesisable. This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative. This yields a remarkable 3-way coincidence between the shifts of polarised System L, LNL calculi, and bidirectional calculi.

### [7] [Strategic Experimentation with Private Payoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06180)
*Jérôme Renault,Eilon Solan,Nicolas Vieille*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了实验结果私有化下的策略性实验博弈，发现均衡实验量高于公开观察实验结果的基准情况，且在纯均衡下至少达到社会最优水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在实验结果私有的情况下，策略性实验博弈中均衡实验量的表现及其与社会最优水平的比较。

Method: 使用指数型bandits模型，分析实验结果私有化对均衡实验量的影响，并提出一种新的鼓励效应。

Result: 均衡实验量始终高于公开观察实验结果的基准情况，且在纯均衡下至少达到社会最优水平。此外，给出了过度实验的严格界限。

Conclusion: 实验结果私有化会导致更高的均衡实验量，并在特定情况下可能超过社会最优水平，这与新的鼓励效应密切相关。

Abstract: We study a strategic experimentation game with exponential bandits, in which experiment outcomes are private. The equilibrium amount of experimentation is always higher than in the benchmark case where experiment outcomes are publicly observed. In addition, for pure equilibria, the equilibrium amount of experimentation is at least socially optimal, and possibly higher. We provide a tight bound on the degree of over-experimentation. The analysis rests on a new form of encouragement effect, according to which a player may hide the absence of a success to encourage future experimentation by the other player, which incentivizes current experimentation.

### [8] [The Communication Complexity of Combinatorial Auctions with Additional Succinct Bidders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06585)

Conclusion: 简洁估值显著增加了组合拍卖的通信复杂性，打破了标准估值类的近似界限。

Abstract: We study the communication complexity of welfare maximization in combinatorial auctions with bidders from either a standard valuation class (which require exponential communication to explicitly state, such as subadditive or XOS), or arbitrary succinct valuations (which can be fully described in polynomial communication, such as single-minded). Although succinct valuations can be efficiently communicated, we show that additional succinct bidders have a nontrivial impact on communication complexity of classical combinatorial auctions. Specifically, let $n$ be the number of subadditive/XOS bidders. We show that for SA $\cup$ SC (the union of subadditive and succinct valuations): (1) There is a polynomial communication $3$-approximation algorithm; (2) As $n \to \infty$, there is a matching $3$-hardness of approximation, which (a) is larger than the optimal approximation ratio of $2$ for SA, and (b) holds even for SA $\cup$ SM (the union of subadditive and single-minded valuations); and (3) For all $n \geq 3$, there is a constant separation between the optimal approximation ratios for SA $\cup$ SM and SA (and therefore between SA $\cup$ SC and SA as well). Similarly, we show that for XOS $\cup$ SC: (1) There is a polynomial communication $2$-approximation algorithm; (2) As $n \to \infty$, there is a matching $2$-hardness of approximation, which (a) is larger than the optimal approximation ratio of $e/(e-1)$ for XOS, and (b) holds even for XOS $\cup$ SM; and (3) For all $n \geq 2$, there is a constant separation between the optimal approximation ratios for XOS $\cup$ SM and XOS (and therefore between XOS $\cup$ SC and XOS as well).

Main category: cs.GT

Result: 研究发现，短期记忆（路径无关）的学习方法优于长期记忆（路径依赖）方法，且输入决策包含了所有相关信息用于信念更新。

Conclusion: 研究表明，企业可以通过短期学习方法有效地掌握真实规模回报，而路径依赖的方法反而会降低学习效果。

Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of learning in a multi-sector general equilibrium model where firms operate under incomplete information about their production returns to scale. Firms iteratively update their beliefs using maximum a-posteriori estimation, derived from observed production outcomes, to refine their knowledge of their returns to scale. The implications of these learning dynamics for market equilibrium and the conditions under which firms can effectively learn their true returns to scale are the key objects of this study. Our results shed light on how idiosyncratic shocks influence the learning process and demonstrate that input decisions encode all pertinent information for belief updates. Additionally, we show that a long-memory (path-dependent) learning which keeps track of all past estimations ends up having a worse performance than a short-memory (path-independent) approach.
