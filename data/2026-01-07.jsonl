Unlike recent neural style transfer or diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for explicit control over the stroke composition and level of detail in the rendered image through the use of an extensible set of stroke patches. The stroke patch sets are procedurally generated by small programs that control the shape, size, orientation, density, color, and noise level of the strokes in the individual patches. Once trained on a set of stroke patches, a U-Net based regression model can render any input image in a variety of distinct, evocative and customizable styles."}

A standard way to obtain this information is to build an intermediate program representation, then use a backwards program analysis to propagate relevant information against the flow of control back to the transformation/optimization site. We instead propose to use prophecy variables, which predict information about the future execution of the program, to enable such transformations and optimizations. We implement prophecy variables in BuildIt, a lightweight domain specific language implementation system. BuildIt uses staged compilation to implement high performance domain specific languages embedded within a standard general purpose programming language (C++). The BuildIt first phase uses standard C++ program execution to generate optimized C, C++, and CUDA second phase code. This approach enables BuildIt to eliminate programming language implementation components such as parsers and intermediate representations, delivering a dramatic decrease in the engineering effort required to implement domain specific languages. The combination of prophecy variables and repeated forward program execution enables BuildIt to extend this approach to include transformations and optimizations that require information about the future execution of the program without backwards analyses and without the engineering overhead associated with implementing these analyses. We formalize the use of prophecy variables for this purpose, discuss the implementation of prophecy variables and repeated execution in BuildIt, and present experimental results for BuildIt computations that benefit from optimizations enabled by the information that prophecy variables provide."}
