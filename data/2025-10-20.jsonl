While classical\neconomic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern\napplications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation\nand blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is\nno longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such\ncontracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to\n\\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic\nmechanism design two decades ago.\n  This article focuses on \\emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier\nwithin algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially\nmany combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a\nteam, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models\ncapture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals\ncoordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of\nengineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)\na single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary\nactions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,\nwe highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity\nbarriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward\nfunctions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and\ndemand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging\nlandscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open\nquestions and promising directions for future work."}

We\nintroduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored\nto hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action\nsequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction.\nWithin this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic\nupper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using\nthe bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms\nsuffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we\nformalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and\nprove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates\nhistorical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.\nExperiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently\noutperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a\nunified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for\ndesigning higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs."}

The seller has access to the\nunderlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various\nactions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through\nbetter decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the\nseller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To\ncontend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the\nbuyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a\ndata product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of\nstatistical experiments.\n  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time\npolynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is\nnaturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm\nwhich, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a\nnear-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We\nthen analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)\nit suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of\nsuch experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)\nfull surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition\nholds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer."}

SPA was\nhistorically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)\nfor bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a\nbinding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher\nrevenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory\ntreatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,\nadvertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to\nQuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to\nbidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For\nautomated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining\noptimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse\nadvertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target\nreturn on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes\ntwo key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal\nbidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic\ntraffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost\nalignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across\nheterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed\nframework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and\nlarge-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over\nexisting methods."}

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via\nalpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a\nphotometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is\ndifficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly\nevident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency\nin static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the\nseverity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality\nobject-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we\naugment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically\ndesigned to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false\ntransparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially\nreduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on\nstandard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness."}

Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers\n(DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs).\nThus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive\nmechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL\ntasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive\nmechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between\na DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished.\nHowever, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the\ncurrent contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic\nIncentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to\nchanges in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation\nof contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL\nsystem is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment\nthat can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs.
