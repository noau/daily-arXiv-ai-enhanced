However, proportionality can come at a cost to the total utilitarian welfare. Our work formalizes this relationship, by deriving minimum utilitarian welfare guarantees for MES for a subclass of satisfaction functions called DNS functions, which includes two of the most popular ways of measuring a voter's utility in the PB setting: considering (1) the total cost of approved projects or (2) the total number of those projects. Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal.

T\u00e2tonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.\n  Analyzing t\u00e2tonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the t\u00e2tonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that na\u00efve t\u00e2tonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative t\u00e2tonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].\n  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \\in (1, \\infty)$, we show that relative t\u00e2tonnement converges to an $\\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52b3\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8bd5\u9519\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bd5\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bd5\u9519\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u8d85\u989d\u9700\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52b3\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c1a\u65e0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bd5\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8d85\u989d\u9700\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u51f8\u4e141-\u9f50\u6b21\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bd5\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\uff08CE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51f8CES\u6548\u7528\u4e0b\u4ee5O(1/\u03b5\u00b2)\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u03b5-CE\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52b3\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u8bd5\u9519\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u3002"}}

Project site: https://rvp-group.github.io/mrhash/", "summary": "Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u65483D\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548cGPU\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f53\u7d20\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u5b58\u50a8\u4f53\u7d20\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbf\u95ee\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8613\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd3D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The principal would like to choose a game that favors one of the players, the social preferences of the players, or the principal's own preferences. Unfortunately, given the potential multiplicity of equilibria, it is conceptually unclear how to tell which of even any two games is better. Oesterheld et al. (2022) propose that we use assumptions about outcome correspondence -- i.e., about how the outcomes of different games relate -- to allow comparisons in some cases. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.\n  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete.

However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), \u00e0 la XTT. The result is a \"h-Set Cubical Type Theory\" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.\n  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating \"type formers preserve h-levels\" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation.

Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SV-LIB\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u683c\u5f0f\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "SV-LIB\u57fa\u4e8e\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SMT-LIB\u8868\u793a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SV-LIB 1.0\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "SV-LIB\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u6027\u3002"}}
