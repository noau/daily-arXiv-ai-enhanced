A tensor field assigns a tensor - a\nmulti-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields,\nsuch as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are\nessential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields\ncaptures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such\nas graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for\nanalyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may\ndistort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and\nvisualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are\npreserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate\npoints essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains\neigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric\ntensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of\neach cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We\nshowcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific\ndata compressors SZ3 and SPERR."}

We propose the\nDualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through\na dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual\nfeature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided\nattenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and\ncan handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale\ndepth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales\nusing a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we\ndesign several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency\nloss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss\ndynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss\nis used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature\nloss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we\ndesign a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the\nwater-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid\ncoastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation\nparameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended\nmatter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality\nis significantly improved."}

In the\nintervening decades, the conversation shifted towards a concurrent line of work\n-- applicative, monadic or arrow-based combinator libraries -- in an effort to\nfind combinators for invertible syntax descriptions that simultaneously\ndetermine a parser as well as a printer, and with more expressive power, able\nto handle inductive structures such as lists and trees. Along the way,\ncontinuation passing got lost. This paper argues that Danvy's insight remains\nas relevant to the general setting as it was to the restricted setting of his\noriginal paper.

Griesbach", "Tobias Harks", "Max Klimm", "Michael Markl", "Philipp Warode"], "title": "Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks", "comment": "29 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we\nstudy how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that\nrespect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general\nmulti-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These\nexternalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the\ntraversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.\n  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as\nWardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are\nnetworks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that\nthe minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.\nThis allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit\nschemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under\nmild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in\ntraffic networks."}

Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered\nabout classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which\ncollective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms'\nretraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our\nframework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of\nfeedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test\ninterventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a\ncase study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.\nWe consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction\nparadigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we\nare able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic\nclassification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the\ninstitutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm\n(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role\nof improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that\nincreased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'\nimprovement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in\npractice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'\nimprovement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's\npopulation plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario\nwhere strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful\nusers and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature."}

We have a valuation function\n$v:2^U \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$\nspecifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current\nwork on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional\nsetting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost\n$c_e$ for supplying item $e$.\n  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe\n$U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\\{G_i\\}$ held by the different players,\nand each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set\n$S_i\\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is\ntruthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given\nbudget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a\nset of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for\nmultidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.\n  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result\nshowing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible\nmechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no\nbudget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We\nidentify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a\nmonopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good\nguarantees.
