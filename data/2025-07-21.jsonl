Saad", "Wonyeol Lee"], "title": "Random Variate Generation with Formal Guarantees", "comment": null, "summary": "This article introduces a new approach to principled and practical random\nvariate generation with formal guarantees. The key idea is to first specify the\ndesired probability distribution in terms of a finite-precision numerical\nprogram that defines its cumulative distribution function (CDF), and then\ngenerate exact random variates according to this CDF. We present a universal\nand fully automated method to synthesize exact random variate generators given\nany numerical CDF implemented in any binary number format, such as\nfloating-point, fixed-point, and posits. The method is guaranteed to operate\nwith the same precision used to specify the CDF, does not overflow, avoids\nexpensive arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and exposes a consistent API. The\nmethod rests on a novel space-time optimal implementation for the class of\ngenerators that attain the information-theoretically optimal Knuth and Yao\nentropy rate, consuming the least possible number of input random bits per\noutput variate. We develop a random variate generation library using our method\nin C and evaluate it on a diverse set of ``continuous'' and ``discrete''\ndistributions, showing competitive runtime with the state-of-the-art GNU\nScientific Library while delivering higher accuracy, entropy efficiency, and\nautomation."}

We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which\nmakes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect\nto an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for\nfunctorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts\non general inductive type formers."}

That is, the semantics keep tracks of\nthe usage of resources, and is stuck, besides in case of type errors, if either\na needed resource is exhausted, or a provided resource would be wasted. In such\nway, the type system guarantees, besides standard soundness, that for\nwell-typed programs there is a computation where no resource gets either\nexhausted or wasted.\n  The no-waste extension is parametric on an arbitrary grade algebra, modeling\nan arbitrary assortment of possible usages, and does not require ad-hoc changes\nto the underlying language. To this end, the semantics needs to be formalized\nin big-step style; as a consequence, expressing and proving (resource-aware)\nsoundness is challenging, and is achieved by applying recent techniques based\non coinductive reasoning."}

The goal is to produce an $\\alpha$-MMS allocation at\nthe end. Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only\nsucceeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions,\nsuch as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by\nassuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu,\n2023). For the general case, the trivial $n$-MMS guarantee remains the best\nknown, while the strongest lower bound is still only $2$.\n  We close this gap on the negative side by proving that for any fixed $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, no algorithm can guarantee an $(n - \\varepsilon)$-MMS\nallocation. Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without\nhiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial\nupper bound.\n  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results.\nWe provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a\n$\\min\\{n, O(k), O(\\log D)\\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of\ndistinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between\nthe largest and smallest disutilities for any agent. This bound is reasonable\nacross a broad range of scenarios and, for example, implies that we can achieve\nan $O(1)$-MMS allocation whenever $k$ is constant. Moreover, to optimize the\nconstant in the important personalized bi-valued case, we show that if each\nagent has at most two distinct disutilities, our algorithm guarantees a $(2 +\n\\sqrt{3}) \\approx 3.7$-MMS allocation."}

Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and\nquantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and\nediting flexibility."}
