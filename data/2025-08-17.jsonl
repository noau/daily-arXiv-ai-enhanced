We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to\n$\\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\\beta$. This means that unless\nFPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\\beta$. The\nlast problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33\nand W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and\npresent an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter \"number of agents with\nties\"."}

We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal\nrouting in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans\nare already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit\ntheir effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the\nroute planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately\ndeployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although\nsolving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle\nframework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,\nmaking the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is\nmodular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We\nevaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively\nto realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling\nthe adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and\ncomparisons with baseline approaches."}

In particular, finding even\napproximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more\nplayers is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for\ncomputing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from\npoor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or\nlack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose\na formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial\ncomplementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial\nbranch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative\nanalysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show\nthe relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of\ncomputing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate\nthat our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods."}

Mitra"], "title": "B-repLer: Semantic B-rep Latent Editor using Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as\na universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many\nspecialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across\nmany applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes\nthem suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards\nspecialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and\nediting tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as\nwell as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate\nwhether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary\nRepresentation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for\nprecisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the\nrepresentation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no\npublicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD\nconstruction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can\nunderstand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce\nvalid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically\ndesigned to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in\nconjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required\nreasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively\nevaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various\ncomplexity, which were not previously possible."}

Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they\nminimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation\nstep is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit\nqubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while\nsatisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the\nlandscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.\nGiven this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for\ndifferent qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error\ncorrection schemes.\n  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing\ncompilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is\ndifferent, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use\nto formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a\ndomain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the\nwell-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.\nWe demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a\npowerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We\nevaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior\nand recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all\nmajor hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated\ncompilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of\nruntime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify\ndevelopment of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue\nto emerge."}
