However, when agents\nhave no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge:\nthe joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which\nslows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates\nthis issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not\non who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate\nfictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency\nof the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents'\nindividual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In\nessence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without\nlosing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical\nevidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence."}

Unlike conventional affine-transform methods\nthat are slow and prone to visual artifacts, our method utilizes a barycentric\nUV conversion technique. Our approach precomputes the entire UV mapping into a\nsingle transformation matrix, enabling texture transfer in a single operation.\nThis results in a speedup of over 7000x compared to the baseline, while also\nsignificantly improving the final texture quality by eliminating boundary\nartifacts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate\nthat our method offers a practical solution for personalization in immersive XR\napplications. The code is available online."}
