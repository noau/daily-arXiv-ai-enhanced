Result: 该方法实现了实时渲染，并能轻松集成到传统渲染管道中，支持在多平台客户端中查看结果。

Conclusion: 通过引入IPC API，该方法解决了3DGS与传统渲染管道集成的难题，扩展了其在实际应用中的可能性。

Abstract: Radiance field-based rendering methods have attracted significant interest from the computer vision and computer graphics communities. They enable high-fidelity rendering with complex real-world lighting effects, but at the cost of high rendering time. 3D Gaussian Splatting solves this issue with a rasterisation-based approach for real-time rendering, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, and extended reality. However, current 3DGS implementations are difficult to integrate into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines, which is a common use case for interactive applications and artistic exploration. To address this limitation, this software solution uses Nvidia's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to easily integrate into implementations and allow the results to be viewed in external clients such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers. The code is available at https://github.com/RockyXu66/splatbus.

### [2] [Remarks on Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15455)
*Patrycja Balik,Szymon Jędras,Piotr Polesiuk*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文指出Jouvelot和Gifford在1991年提出的类型和效果重构算法中存在与变量绑定相关的细微错误，并重新审视了他们的类型系统和重构算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文的动机是识别并解决Jouvelot和Gifford在1991年提出的类型和效果重构算法中与高阶多态性相关的变量绑定问题。

Method: 论文重新审视了Jouvelot和Gifford的类型系统和重构算法，详细描述了发现的变量绑定问题。

Result: 研究发现了原算法中与高阶多态性相关的变量绑定错误，并对其进行了详细描述。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是指出并纠正了Jouvelot和Gifford算法中的变量绑定问题，为后续研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: In their 1991 paper "Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects," Pierre Jouvelot and David Gifford presented a type-and-effect reconstruction algorithm based on an algebraic structure of effects. Their work is considered a milestone in the development of type-and-effect systems, and has inspired numerous subsequent works in the area of static analysis. However, unlike the later research it spawned, the original algorithm considered a language with higher-rank polymorphism, a feature which is challenging to implement correctly. In this note, we identify subtle bugs related to variable binding in their approach to this feature. We revisit their type system and reconstruction algorithm, and describe the discovered issues.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于编译器的方法RustyEx，用于优先处理Rust语言中的配置组合爆炸问题，通过中间表示和中心性度量生成最相关的配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代编程语言（如Rust）的高度可配置性导致配置组合爆炸，使得程序分析、优化和测试变得困难，需要一种方法来有效优先处理配置。

Method: 方法包括从Rust编译器提取中间表示，构建图数据结构，使用中心性度量对特征排序，并通过SAT求解器生成有效配置。

Result: 在开源Rust项目上的实证评估表明，RustyEx能够在有限资源内高效生成用户指定的配置，并确保其正确性。

Conclusion: 中心性引导的配置优先级划分方法为大规模配置空间的探索提供了实用解决方案，为未来的配置感知分析和优化研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern programming languages, most notably Rust, offer advanced linguistic constructs for building highly configurable software systems as aggregation of features -- identified by a configuration. However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.

### [4] [Do people expect different behavior from large language models acting on their behalf? Evidence from norm elicitations in two canonical economic games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15312)
*Paweł Niszczota,Elia Antoniou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究发现，当大型语言模型（LLM）代表人们分配资源时，社会对其行为的评价与人类行为有所不同，但人们对由机器执行规范的行为并无反感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）在任务委托中可能产生的社会成本，特别是在资源分配和公平性监控方面，以及人们对这些行为的期望变化。

Method: 通过两种经典经济游戏（独裁者游戏和最后通牒游戏）以及Krupka-Weber规范引发任务，研究人们对LLM行为的评价变化。实验使用英国和美国的代表性样本（N = 2,658）。

Result: 1. 机器的行为在不需要接受的情况下被认为不如人类行为合适；2. 在需要接受的情况下，拒绝机器的行为比拒绝人类行为更被接受；3. 机器的拒绝行为与人类的拒绝行为在社会评价上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 人们对机器分配资源的行为有不同的规范要求，但对机器执行规范的行为并无反感，表明机器的行为被赋予了认知和情感的双重成分。

Abstract: While delegating tasks to large language models (LLMs) can save people time, there is growing evidence that offloading tasks to such models produces social costs. We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component.

### [5] [On the closest balanced game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15318)
*Pedro García-Segador,Michel Grabisch,Dylan Laplace Mermoud,Pedro Miranda*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种快速算法，用于找到核心为空的合作游戏到最近平衡游戏的正交投影，避免优化问题的指数复杂度，并证明了当玩家数量增加时，最近游戏的核心趋于单点解的概率趋近于1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究核心为空的合作游戏如何通过正交投影找到最近的平衡游戏，以解决传统分析方法在处理玩家数量增加时复杂度高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种快速算法，避免指数复杂度的优化问题，能够在最多20个玩家的情况下运行，并通过实验和数学证明了核心趋于单点解的概率。

Result: 实验和数学证明表明，当玩家数量增加时，最近平衡游戏的核心趋于单点解的概率趋近于1，并且具有非单点解核心的游戏面比例趋近于0。

Conclusion: 通过正交投影定义一个新的解概念——最小二乘核心，结果显示随着玩家数量的增加，该解趋于单点解的概率趋近于1。

Abstract: Cooperative games with nonempty core are called balanced, and the set of balanced games is a polyhedron. Given a game with empty core, we look for the closest balanced game, in the sense of the (weighted) Euclidean distance, i.e., the orthogonal projection of the game on the set of balanced games. Besides an analytical approach which becomes rapidly intractable, we propose a fast algorithm to find the closest balanced game, avoiding exponential complexity for the optimization problem, and being able to run up to 20 players. We show experimentally that the probability that the closest game has a core reduced to a singleton tends to 1 when the number of players grow. We provide a mathematical proof that the proportion of facets whose games have a non-singleton core tends to 0 when the number of players grow, by finding an expression of the aymptotic growth of the number of minimal balanced collections. This permits to prove mathematically the experimental result. Consequently, taking the core of the projected game defines a new solution concept, which we call least square core due to its analogy with the least core, and our result shows that the probability that this is a point solution tends to 1 when the number of players grow.

### [6] [Rules Create Unequal Rewards: Elite Tennis Players Allocate Resources Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15327)
*Masatsugu Yoshizawa,Yuta Kawamoto,Daisuke Takeshita*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究表明，顶级网球选手能够根据比赛规则和比分变化高效分配资源，即在某些比分下减少获胜点数的概率，以节省体力用于后续比赛，这种行为特别是在接发球局中表现明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨在竞争环境中，如何高效分配有限资源以获得成功。规则的阈值效应使得某些时刻更为重要，但现实中努力分配难以观察且反馈延迟，因此选择职业网球作为研究场景。

Method: 通过分析网球比赛中比分依赖的得分概率，推导出每个选手的帕累托边界——即在获胜概率和每局预期得分之间的理论极限。研究者进一步考察选手在不同比分下的行为策略。

Result: 顶级选手在比分落后时减少获胜点数的概率，尤其是在接发球局中表现出更高的适应能力。这种策略符合博弈论的预测，表明他们在资源分配上更接近帕累托边界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精英表现反映了对规则创造的价值结构的高效适应。在某些情况下，知道何时放弃与知道何时竞争同样重要，这是专家技能的核心之一。

Abstract: In many competitive settings, from education to politics, rules do not reward effort evenly, and thresholds (e.g., grade cutoffs or electoral majorities) make some moments disproportionately important. Success thus depends on efficiently allocating limited resources. However, empirical demonstration has been difficult because effort allocation is rarely observable and feedback is often delayed, limiting our understanding of expertise. Professional tennis provides an ideal natural experiment. Because each game resets after a player wins four points and points in a lost game are wasted, the value of a point varies sharply across scores. Efficient allocation should therefore win games without wasting points, conserving resources for future games. Such allocation manifests in score-dependent point-winning probabilities, from which we derive each player's Pareto frontier-the theoretical limit of the trade-off between game-winning probability and the expected points per game. Here, we show that top players operate closer to this frontier, converting points to game wins more efficiently. Optimal strategies reduce the probability of winning points when the player is far behind (e.g.,0-2, 0-3). This behavior is psychologically difficult-letting go of the current game-but represents a rational energy conservation strategy. Top players exhibit this pattern especially in return games, where winning points is harder than in service games, requiring them to drastically vary their efforts, consistent with game-theoretic predictions. These findings suggest that elite performance reflects efficient adaptation to rule-created value structures; knowing when to give up may be as fundamental to expertise as knowing when to compete.

### [7] [Equal-Pay Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15478)
*Michal Feldman,Yoav Gal-Tzur,Tomasz Ponitka,Maya Schlesinger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体合同设计，其中委托人通过组合奖励函数激励团队采取共同决定项目成功的成本行动。重点探讨了支付分散受限的等酬合同，并提供了算法和硬度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中很多情况下限制了支付的分散性，因此本文研究了等酬合同，即所有智能体获得相同报酬的情况，扩展了先前对非约束合同的研究。

Method: 研究采用了等酬和近似等酬合同，并通过算法设计（多项式时间O(1)近似算法）和理论硬度结果（排除了PTAS的存在性和O(1)近似的可能性）分析了广泛的奖励函数层次结构。

Result: 本文在正反两方面做出了贡献：设计了针对组合动作下的子模奖励和二进制动作下的XOS奖励的算法，同时证明了在某些情况下近似算法的不可行性。此外，通过“公平价格”量化了公平性带来的损失，提出了Θ(log n/log log n)的界限。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，等酬合同在现实环境中具有重要价值，同时为非约束合同设计提供了新见解，并解决了相关的开放问题。

Abstract: We study multi-agent contract design, where a principal incentivizes a team of agents to take costly actions that jointly determine the project success via a combinatorial reward function. While prior work largely focuses on unconstrained contracts that allow heterogeneous payments across agents, many real-world environments limit payment dispersion. Motivated by this, we study equal-pay contracts, where all agents receive identical payments. Our results also extend to nearly-equal-pay contracts where any two payments are identical up to a constant factor.
  We provide both algorithmic and hardness results across a broad hierarchy of reward functions, under both binary and combinatorial action models. While we focus on equal-pay contracts, our analysis also yields new insights into unconstrained contract design, and resolves two important open problems. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time O(1)-approximation algorithms for (i) submodular rewards under combinatorial actions, and (ii) XOS rewards under binary actions. These guarantees are tight: We rule out the existence of (i) a PTAS for combinatorial actions, even for gross substitutes rewards (unless P = NP), and (ii) any O(1)-approximation for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions. Crucially, our hardness results hold even for unconstrained contracts, thereby settling the corresponding open problems in this setting.
  Finally, we quantify the loss induced by fairness via the price of equality, defined as the worst-case ratio between the optimal principal's utility achievable by unconstrained contracts and that achievable by equal-pay contracts. We obtain a bound of $Θ(\log n/ \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents. This gap is tight in a strong sense: the upper bound applies even for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions, while the lower bound arises already for additive rewards with binary actions.

Result: 研究发现，战略性竞选在改变选举结果方面具有实际效果，特别是在选举门槛和选区数量的影响下。第二选择模式的引入也展示了其在计算复杂性上的新结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，战略性竞选在议会选举中具有显著影响力，而第二选择模式为选举系统设计提供了新的视角和复杂性结果。

Abstract: In parliamentary elections, parties compete for a limited, typically fixed number of seats. Most parliaments are assembled using apportionment methods that distribute the seats based on the parties' vote counts. Common apportionment methods include divisor sequence methods (like D'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë), the largest-remainder method, and first-past-the-post. In many countries, an electoral threshold is implemented to prevent very small parties from entering the parliament. Further, several countries have apportionment systems that incorporate multiple districts. We study how computationally hard it is to change the election outcome (i.e., to increase or limit the influence of a distinguished party) by convincing a limited number of voters to change their vote. We refer to these bribery-style attacks as \emph{strategic campaigns} and study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational (both classical and parameterized) complexity. We also run extensive experiments on real-world election data and study the effectiveness of optimal campaigns, in particular as opposed to using heuristic bribing strategies and with respect to the influence of the threshold and the influence of the number of districts. For apportionment elections with threshold, finally, we propose -- as an alternative to the standard top-choice mode -- the second-chance mode where voters of parties below the threshold receive a second chance to vote for another party, and we establish computational complexity results also in this setting.

### [9] [Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation Beyond Identical Valuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15864)

Conclusion: 本文为非相同估值下的ME-GHA问题提供了新的洞见和解决方案，扩展了现有研究的范围，并为未来的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: House allocation is an extremely well-studied problem in the field of fair allocation, where the goal is to assign $n$ houses to $n$ agents while satisfying certain fairness criterion, e.g., envy-freeness. To model social interactions, the Graphical House Allocation framework introduces a social graph $G$, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, and an edge $(u, v)$ corresponds to the potential of agent $u$ to envy the agent $v$, based on their allocations and valuations. In undirected social graphs, the potential for envy is in both the directions. In the Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation (ME-GHA) problem, given a set of $n$ agents, $n$ houses, a social graph, and agent's valuation functions, the goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total envy summed up over all the edges of $G$. Recent work, [Hosseini et al., AAMAS 2023, AAMAS 2024] studied ME-GHA in the regime of polynomial-time algorithms, and designed exact and approximation algorithms, for certain graph classes under identical agent valuations. We initiate the study of \gha with non-identical valuations, a setting that has so far remained unexplored. We investigate the multivariate (parameterized) complexity of \gha by identifying structural restrictions on the social graph and valuation functions that yield tractability. We also design moderately exponential-time algorithms for several graph classes, and a polynomial-time algorithm for {binary valuations that returns an allocation with envy at most one when the social graph has maximum degree at most one.
