Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

### [2] [Taking Language Embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting into the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19830)
*Yuze Wang,Yue Qi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于3D高斯散射和语言嵌入的新框架，用于从无约束照片集合中实现开放词汇场景理解，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前利用互联网照片进行3D重建的研究主要关注虚拟探索，而忽略了建筑风格和结构知识的沉浸式理解。因此，论文旨在利用无约束照片集合，开发一种沉浸式方法，理解建筑组件的3D结构。

Method: 论文扩展了语言嵌入的3D高斯散射（3DGS）技术，提出了一种新框架。具体包括：从重建的辐射场中渲染多外观图像，提取多外观CLIP特征和语言特征不确定性图，提出瞬时不确定性感知自编码器和多外观语言场3DGS表示，以及后集成策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在开放词汇分割任务上优于现有方法，并支持交互式漫游、建筑风格模式识别和3D场景编辑等应用。

Conclusion: 论文成功提出了一种新框架，能够从无约束照片集合中实现开放词汇场景理解，为建筑风格和结构知识的沉浸式理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

### [3] [ChoreoMuse: Robust Music-to-Dance Video Generation with Style Transfer and Beat-Adherent Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19836)
*Xuanchen Wang,Heng Wang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ChoreoMuse是一个基于扩散模型的舞蹈视频生成框架，能够根据音乐节奏和用户定义的舞蹈风格生成高质量的视频，适用于多样化的音乐类型和舞者特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代艺术制作需要能够适应多样化音乐风格和个体舞者特征的自动化编舞生成。现有方法在生成与音乐节奏和用户定义风格相协调的高质量舞蹈视频方面表现不足。

Method: ChoreoMuse使用SMPL格式参数作为音乐和视频生成的中间媒介，结合新型音乐编码器MotionTune从音频中提取运动提示，并通过两个新指标定量评估舞蹈与音乐及编舞风格的匹配程度。

Result: 实验证明，ChoreoMuse在视频质量、节拍对齐、舞蹈多样性和风格一致性等多个维度上达到最新技术水平的性能。

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse是一种适用于广泛创意应用的强大解决方案，能够支持风格可控、高保真的舞蹈视频生成。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

### [4] [Neural Shell Texture Splatting: More Details and Fewer Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20200)
*Xin Zhang,Anpei Chen,Jincheng Xiong,Pinxuan Dai,Yujun Shen,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种神经壳纹理方法，通过解构高斯着色中的几何与外观纠缠，实现高效的参数使用和精细纹理重建，同时减少了基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯着色技术在新视角合成中表现出色，但高重建质量需要大量基元，这是由于几何与外观的纠缠问题。作者希望通过解构这两者来提高效率。

Method: 引入神经壳纹理作为全局表示，用高斯基元同时表示几何和纹理采样器，高效地将纹理特征映射到图像空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著减少基元数量的同时，实现了高参数效率、精细纹理重建和易于纹理网格提取。

Conclusion: 通过解构几何与外观，该方法在高斯着色中实现了高效、高质量的纹理表示，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

### [5] [Methodology for intelligent injection point location based on geometric algorithms and discrete topologies for virtual digital twin environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20922)
*J. Mercado Colmenero,A. Torres Alba,C. Martin Donate*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于注塑件注射点定位的创新方法，结合几何算法和智能模型，实现均匀的熔融塑料分布，并通过实验验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的注塑模具进料系统设计依赖专家干预，耗时且成本高。本文旨在开发一种无需专家干预的自动化方法，以降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 采用几何算法和智能模型，包括计算离散模型重心、生成几何矩阵及正交投影等子算法，最终确定最优注射点位置。

Result: 通过六个复杂几何案例的流变学模拟验证，该方法实现了熔融塑料的均匀分布，并显著降低了填充阶段的压力损失。

Conclusion: 该方法无需专家干预，节省了时间和成本，适用于多种设计环境和虚拟孪生系统，并为新产品设计提供了高效的数字化解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents an innovative methodology for locating injection points
in injection-molded parts using intelligent models with geometric algorithms
for discrete topologies. The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of
the discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the
system, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity
filling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal
injection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix
based on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box.
The second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular
areas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The
optimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to
the center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology
has been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with
complex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten
plastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase.
Importantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing
time and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design. It is
also adaptable to various design environments and virtual twin systems, not
tied to specific CAD software. The validated results surpass the state of the
art, offering an agile alternative for digital twin applications in new product
design environments, reducing dependence on experts, facilitating designer
training, and ultimately cutting costs

### [6] [Development and Evaluation of Adaptive LearningSupport System Based on Ontology of MultipleProgramming Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19728)
*Lalita Na Nongkhai,Jingyun Wang,Takahiko Mendori*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于本体的自适应学习支持系统ADVENTURE，用于计算机编程教育。该系统通过利用名为CONTINUOUS的本体和Elo评分系统，提供个性化的编程练习，结果显示自适应模式在正确答题和通过概念数量上显著优于随机模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对编程教育中个性化学习的需求，开发一种能够根据学习者技能水平动态调整练习的自适应系统。

Method: 系统采用名为CONTINUOUS的本体来可视化编程概念并提供提示，结合Elo评分系统动态调整练习难度。

Result: 实验比较了自适应和随机两种模式，结果显示自适应模式在正确答题和通过概念数量上显著优于随机模式。

Conclusion: ADVENTURE系统有效支持学习者进行编程练习，自适应模式比随机模式更能提升学习效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces an ontology-based approach within an adaptive learning
support system for computer programming. This system (named ADVENTURE) is
designed to deliver personalized programming exercises that are tailored to
individual learners' skill levels. ADVENTURE utilizes an ontology, named
CONTINUOUS, which encompasses common concepts across multiple programming
languages. The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming
concepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and
recommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by
the Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically
estimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An
experimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based
on six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental
groups. The results indicate significant differences in four of six analyzed
features between these two modes. Notably, the adaptive mode demonstrates a
significant difference over the random mode in two features, the submission of
correct answers and the number of pass concepts. Therefore, these results
underscore that this adaptive learning support system may support learners in
practicing programming exercises.

### [7] [The Power of Negation in Higher-Order Datalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20251)
*Angelos Charalambidis,Babis Kostopoulos,Christos Nomikos,Panos Rondogiannis*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 研究了高阶Datalog$^\neg$在良基语义和稳定模型语义下的表达能力，证明了其与复杂度类别的紧密联系，并展示了阶数增加与非确定性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高阶Datalog$^\neg$在不同语义下的表达能力，揭示其与复杂度类别的对应关系，以及阶数与非确定性之间的交互作用。

Method: 通过使用语言的强大存在谓词变量、部分应用关系和关系枚举，证明了在良基语义下$(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$捕获k-EXP的能力；在稳定模型语义下，展示了其捕获co-(k-NEXP)和k-NEXP的能力。

Result: 在良基语义下，$(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$捕获k-EXP；在稳定模型语义下，使用谨慎推理捕获co-(k-NEXP)，使用勇敢推理捕获k-NEXP。分层片段也表现出类似的表达能力。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个表达能力层次结构，展示了在更高阶逻辑编程中阶数增加与非确定性之间的权衡，良基语义下的高阶程序可以超越低阶程序在稳定模型语义下的表达能力。

Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both
the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections
with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for
all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds
without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be
performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the
language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a
stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show
that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning
and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the
stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a
hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between
order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming:
increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass
the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.

### [8] [Flexible Bidding in Service-Oriented Combinatorial Spectrum Forward Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19720)
*Xiang Shao,Wei Wang,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的近似真实的组合正向拍卖方案，通过灵活投标机制提升频谱资源效率和社会福利最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的频谱拍卖固定投标和匹配机制限制了参与者策略的灵活性，导致动态频谱共享环境中社会福利不够优化。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的投标机制，买家提交包含基础频谱需求和可调整需求范围的组合投标，拍卖者通过频谱等效映射(SEM)系数标准化频段估值，并采用贪心匹配算法对资源进行动态分配。

Result: 仿真结果表明，灵活的投标机制显著优于现有基准方法，在动态频谱共享场景中实现了更高的社会福利。

Conclusion: 提出的方案通过动态优化频谱分配提高了资源效率和社会福利，适用于动态频谱共享环境。

Abstract: Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and
matching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies
and often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing
environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately
truthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism
aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the
proposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base
spectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to
dynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To
standardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a
Spectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is
employed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent
unit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly
outperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare
in dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.

Abstract: Consider costly tasks that add up to the success of a project, and must be
fitted by an agent into a given time-frame. This is an instance of the classic
budgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS).
Now assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is
the one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design
a contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In
this work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which
transforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)
to tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach
diverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an
assumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.
  We first show how to "lift" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the
best-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design
problem. We establish this through our "local-global" framework, in which the
"local" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of
the demand problem. The "global" step then utilizes the local one to find the
approximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of
combinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted
matroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an
approximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely
algorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract
settings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial
feasibility constraints.

### [10] [Fairness under Equal-Sized Bundles: Impossibility Results and Approximation Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20899)
*Alviona Mancho,Evangelos Markakis,Nicos Protopapas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在基数约束下不可分割物品的公平分配问题，引入了基于翻转的EF1和EFX概念（EFF1, EFFX），并展示了算法和不可能性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不可分割物品在固定大小分配中的公平分配问题，适用于实际场景如任务分配或团队组建，提出了基于翻转的新公平性标准。

Method: 论文探索了现有技术的局限性，并提出了新的算法，包括共享排名时的常数近似保证和最大化Nash福利的1/2-EFF1分配。

Result: 展示了现有技术无法保证EFFX近似，但在特定条件下（如共享排名或一致价值函数上限）可获得近似保证，同时证明了1/2-EFF1分配的紧性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了经典EFX与翻转基础的EFFX之间的显著差异，提出了新算法在特定条件下的近似保证，并证明了1/2-EFF1分配的最优性。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods under cardinality
constraints, where each agent must receive a bundle of fixed size. This models
practical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams.
Recently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were
introduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one
can define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent
$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip
between their bundles that improves the value of $i$.
  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is
twofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a
stark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.
First, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they
fail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we
can achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a
common ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination
technique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation
guarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions
are bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare
guarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.

TL;DR: 可视化仪表盘在拍卖等战略环境中被用于提升决策质量，本文通过实验评估不同仪表盘设计对竞标优化的影响，发现基于效用的可视化显著提升竞标表现，但竞标者仍倾向于低估出价。仪表盘设计对偏好推断的准确性有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究可视化仪表盘在拍卖环境中的实际效果，探讨不同设计如何影响竞标者的决策和拍卖者对竞标者偏好的准确推断。

Method: 通过行为实验，比较常见的出价分配规则可视化与基于预期效用的可视化设计，分析其对竞标行为和偏好推断的影响。

Result: 基于效用的可视化显著降低了竞标者的认知负荷，但竞标者仍系统性低估出价。仪表盘设计对偏好推断的准确性产生显著影响，未考虑行为反应的模型会引入估计误差。

Conclusion: 实际应用中需将可视化设计与经济推断假设对齐，明确建模竞标者对仪表盘的行为反应可以提升推断准确性，避免次优分配。

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like
auctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper
presents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs
affect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we
assess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to
accurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework.
We compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in
practice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that
utility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing
cognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders
systematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for
certain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms
that assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can
produce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which
may lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents'
behavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy,
highlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference
assumptions in practice.
