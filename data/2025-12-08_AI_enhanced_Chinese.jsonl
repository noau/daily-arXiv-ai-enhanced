In this problem, we seek a mechanism that (probabilistically) identifies the winner of a tournament after observing round-robin play among $n$ teams in a league. Such a mechanism should satisfy the natural properties of monotonicity and Condorcet consistency. Moreover, from the league's perspective, the winner-determination tournament rule should be strategyproof, meaning that no team can do better by losing a game on purpose.\n  Past work considered settings in which each team is fully selfish, caring only about its own probability of winning, and settings in which each team is fully selfless, caring only about the total winning probability of itself and the team to which it deliberately loses. More recently, researchers considered a mixture of these two settings with a parameter $\u03bb$. Intermediate selfishness $\u03bb$ means that a team will not lose on purpose unless its pair gains at least $\u03bbs$ winning probability, where $s$ is the individual team's sacrifice from its own winning probability. All of the dozens of previously known tournament rules require $\u03bb= \u03a9(n)$ to be strategyproof, and it has been an open problem to find such a rule with the smallest $\u03bb$.\n  In this work, we make significant progress by designing a tournament rule that is strategyproof with $\u03bb= 11$. Along the way, we propose a new notion of multiplicative pairwise non-manipulability that ensures that two teams cannot manipulate the outcome of a game to increase the sum of their winning probabilities by more than a multiplicative factor $\u03b4$ and provide a rule which is multiplicatively pairwise non-manipulable for $\u03b4= 3.5$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u81ea\u5229\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u4f4e\u81f311\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e58\u6027\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e24\u961f\u64cd\u7eb5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u603b\u548c\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e58\u6027\u56e0\u5b503.5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u4e0a\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u81ea\u5229\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u03bb=\u03a9(n)\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u64cd\u7eb5\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548cCondorcet\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u6027\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u9650\u5236\u64cd\u7eb5\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u03bb=11\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u03b4=3.5\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u81ea\u5229\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $\u03c9(\\sqrt{n})$.

Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less.

We propose a model in which a candidate's priority scores across different decision-makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate's sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice due to the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions due to test-optional policies, or due to algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision-makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation.

This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers.

Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u5bfc-\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3aStackelberg\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548cBellman\u9012\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u5bfc-\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u5728\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u627f\u8bfa\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eBellman\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\uff08\u53ef\u4fe1\u96c6\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u7684\u7406\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7b56\u7565\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u03b5-\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u5bfc\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3aStackelberg\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u683c\uff08Invariant PoA\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfPoA\u5206\u6790\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPoA\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4ee3\u8868\u4ee3\u7406\u504f\u597d\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u800c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e0d\u53d8PoA\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ea6\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u786e\u4fdd\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53d7\u6210\u672c\u7f29\u653e\u6216\u5e73\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73a9\u5177\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u82cf\u9ece\u4e16\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u8d39\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}
