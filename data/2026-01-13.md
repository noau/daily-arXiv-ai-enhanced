Result: 研究揭示模型在特殊體型細節重建上的局限，並理解為感知-失真權衡的副產品。

Abstract: The recent release of SAM 3D Body \cite{sam3dbody2025} marks a significant milestone in human mesh recovery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in producing clean, topologically coherent meshes from single images. By leveraging the novel Momentum Human Rig (MHR), it achieves remarkable robustness to occlusion and diverse poses. However, our evaluation reveals a specific and consistent limitation: the model struggles to reconstruct detailed anthropometric deviations, especially on populations with special body shape alters such as geriatric muscle atrophy, scoliosis, or pregnancy, even when these features are prominent in the input image. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon not as a failure of the model's capacity, but as a byproduct of the \textit{perception-distortion trade-off}. We posit that the architectural reliance on the low-dimensional parametric MHR representation, combined with semantic-invariant conditioning (DINOv3) and annotation-based alignment, creates a \enquote{regression to the mean} effect. We analyze these mechanisms to understand why individual biological details are smoothed out and propose specific, constructive pathways for future work to extend the impressive baseline performance of SAM 3D Body into the medical domain.

### [2] [RigMo: Unifying Rig and Motion Learning for Generative Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06378)
*Hao Zhang,Jiahao Luo,Bohui Wan,Yizhou Zhao,Zongrui Li,Michael Vasilkovsky,Chaoyang Wang,Jian Wang,Narendra Ahuja,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RigMo是一个统一的生成框架，直接从原始网格序列中联合学习骨骼和运动，无需人工标注，实现可动画化的网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动画生成流程将骨骼和运动视为独立问题，依赖真实骨骼和蒙皮权重，限制了可扩展性和可解释性。RigMo旨在解决这一问题，提供统一的解决方案。

Method: RigMo通过将顶点变形编码为两个紧凑的潜在空间（骨骼潜在空间和运动潜在空间），显式解码为高斯骨骼、蒙皮权重和时间变化的SE(3)变换。

Result: 实验表明，RigMo能够学习平滑、可解释且物理上合理的骨骼，并在重建和类别级泛化方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RigMo为统一的、结构感知的和可扩展的动态3D建模建立了新范式。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D generation, rig and motion, the core structural and dynamic components of animation are typically modeled as separate problems. Existing pipelines rely on ground-truth skeletons and skinning weights for motion generation and treat auto-rigging as an independent process, undermining scalability and interpretability. We present RigMo, a unified generative framework that jointly learns rig and motion directly from raw mesh sequences, without any human-provided rig annotations. RigMo encodes per-vertex deformations into two compact latent spaces: a rig latent that decodes into explicit Gaussian bones and skinning weights, and a motion latent that produces time-varying SE(3) transformations. Together, these outputs define an animatable mesh with explicit structure and coherent motion, enabling feed-forward rig and motion inference for deformable objects. Beyond unified rig-motion discovery, we introduce a Motion-DiT model operating in RigMo's latent space and demonstrate that these structure-aware latents can naturally support downstream motion generation tasks. Experiments on DeformingThings4D, Objaverse-XL, and TrueBones demonstrate that RigMo learns smooth, interpretable, and physically plausible rigs, while achieving superior reconstruction and category-level generalization compared to existing auto-rigging and deformation baselines. RigMo establishes a new paradigm for unified, structure-aware, and scalable dynamic 3D modeling.

Motivation: 现有维恩图构造方法在可读性和可定制性方面存在不足，VennFan旨在通过创新的三角函数边界投影技术解决这些问题。

Method: VennFan利用极坐标投影和形状化正弦/余弦函数，生成风扇叶片样式的维恩图，并提供自动标签放置策略。

Abstract: We introduce VennFan, a method for generating $n$-set Venn diagrams based on the polar coordinate projection of trigonometric boundaries, resulting in Venn diagrams that resemble a set of fan blades. Unlike most classical constructions, our method emphasizes readability and customizability by using shaped sinusoids and amplitude scaling. We describe both sine- and cosine-based variants of VennFan and propose an automatic label placement heuristic tailored to these fan-like layouts. VennFan is available as a Python package (https://pypi.org/project/vennfan/).

Conclusion: $ackslashmathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON提供了一种高效、轻量的主动重建方法，显著提升了渲染质量和重建效率。

Abstract: In active reconstruction, an embodied agent must decide where to look next to efficiently acquire views that support high-quality novel-view rendering. Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training. This renderability field is strongly correlated with image-space reconstruction error, naturally guiding NBV selection. We further introduce a panoramic extension that estimates omnidirectional (360$^\circ$) view utility to accelerate candidate evaluation. In the standard indoor Replica dataset, $\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON achieves more uniform novel-view quality and higher 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) reconstruction accuracy than recent active GS baselines with matched view and time budgets.

### [5] [Coalition Tactics: Bribery and Control in Parliamentary Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07279)
*Hodaya Barr,Eden Hartman,Yonatan Aumann,Sarit Kraus*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在议会选举中，通过策略性操纵来提升联盟整体席位数的问题，特别关注比例代表制选举中的贿赂和控制两种操纵方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在议会选举中，选民可能更关注执政联盟的整体席位而非单个政党的席位，这引发了对如何通过策略性操纵提升联盟席位的新问题。

Method: 研究采用比例代表制选举，探讨两种问题变体：一种是最大化联盟席位数，另一种是同时提升联盟和联盟内某政党的相对实力。分析了贿赂（修改选民偏好）和控制（调整选民与政党集合）两种操纵方式。

Result: 对于某些贿赂问题，提出了多项式时间算法，而对其他问题证明了NP难度。在控制问题中，添加和删除选民的操作有多项式时间算法，而添加和删除政党的操作要么不可能，要么是W[1]-难的。

Conclusion: 研究表明，议会选举中的策略性操纵问题因具体操作类型而异，部分操作在计算上可行，而其他操作则具有较高的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Strategic manipulation of elections is typically studied in the context of promoting individual candidates.
  In parliamentary elections, however, the focus shifts: voters may care more about the overall governing coalition than the individual parties' seat counts.
  This paper studies this new problem: manipulating parliamentary elections with the goal of promoting the collective seat count of a coalition of parties.
  We focus on proportional representation elections, and consider two variants of the problem; one in which the sole goal is to maximize the total number of seats held by the desired coalition, and the other with a dual objective of both promoting the coalition and promoting the relative power of some favorite party within the coalition.
  We examine two types of strategic manipulations:
  \emph{bribery}, which allows modifying voters' preferences, and \emph{control}, which allows
  changing the sets of voters and parties.
  We consider multiple bribery types, presenting polynomial-time algorithms for some, while proving NP-hardness for others.
  For control, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for control by adding and deleting voters. In contrast, control by adding and deleting parties, we show, is either impossible (i.e., the problem is immune to control) or computationally hard, in particular, W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of parties that can be added or deleted.

### [6] [Machine Learning Model Trading with Verification under Information Asymmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07510)
*Xiang Li,Jianwei Huang,Kai Yang,Chenyou Fan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种博弈论方法来解决机器学习模型交易中的信息不对称问题，通过验证步骤让买家在购买前检查模型质量，从而减少卖方欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型交易中存在信息不对称问题，卖方可能通过欺骗行为虚报模型性能以获取更高利润。当前文献尚未完全解决这一问题。

Method: 采用博弈论方法，在模型交易市场中引入验证步骤，允许买家在购买前检查模型质量。分析卖方欺骗行为的概率，并设计最优定价方案。

Result: 研究发现，验证准确性降低欺骗概率，而验证成本增加欺骗概率。减少信息不对称对买卖双方均有利，而保护买家订单信息则无助于提升收益。

Conclusion: 减少信息不对称在机器学习模型交易中至关重要，研究结果为未来相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) model trading, known for its role in protecting data privacy, faces a major challenge: information asymmetry. This issue can lead to model deception, a problem that current literature has not fully solved, where the seller misrepresents model performance to earn more. We propose a game-theoretic approach, adding a verification step in the ML model market that lets buyers check model quality before buying. However, this method can be expensive and offers imperfect information, making it harder for buyers to decide. Our analysis reveals that a seller might probabilistically conduct model deception considering the chance of model verification. This deception probability decreases with the verification accuracy and increases with the verification cost. To maximize seller payoff, we further design optimal pricing schemes accounting for heterogeneous buyers' strategic behaviors. Interestingly, we find that reducing information asymmetry benefits both the seller and buyer. Meanwhile, protecting buyer order information doesn't improve the payoff for the buyer or the seller. These findings highlight the importance of reducing information asymmetry in ML model trading and open new directions for future research.

### [7] [Enforcing Priority in Schedule-based User Equilibrium Transit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07712)
*Liyang Feng,Hanlin Sun,Yu Marco Nie,Jun Xie,Jiayang Li*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了Nguyen等人（2001）的隐式优先框架，通过制定等效的非线性互补问题（NCP）并建立均衡存在性，改进了行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于时刻表的模型在动态加载中通过显式方式强制执行优先规则，但离散车辆运行可能导致行为不一致。本文旨在解决这一问题并改进均衡计算。

Method: 本文推导了等效的NCP公式，提出了细化后的弧级NCP公式，并将其重新表述为连续可微的MPEC问题，提出了两种求解算法。

Result: 数值研究表明，该模型成功再现了连续优先和FCFS排队规则，并捕捉了由登机优先竞争驱动的出发时间变化（FCFS）登车优先权的竞争驱动的出发时间变化。

Conclusion: 本文通过改进的NCP框架和行为一致性的均衡概念，为交通分配模型提供了更准确和计算可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.

### [8] [Structural Approach to Guiding a Present-Biased Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07763)

Conclusion: 本文明确了问题的可解与不可解区域，扩展了Belova等人（2024）的研究，并通过参数化方法为行为经济学中的类似问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Time-inconsistent behavior, such as procrastination or abandonment of long-term goals, arises when agents evaluate immediate outcomes disproportionately higher than future ones. This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure. We demonstrate that our main result yields efficient algorithms for a number of such configurations.
  We complement this with tight hardness results, that highlight the extreme difficulty of the problem even on simplest graphs with bounded number of nodes and constant parameter values, and motivate our choice of parameters. We delineate tractable and intractable regions of the problem landscape, which include answers to open questions of Belova et al. (2024).

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了两种变体的无限持续时间游戏的复杂性，其中节点控制权不是预定的，而是随机分配的。定性问题是NL完全的，定量问题在第一种机制下是PSPACE完全的，第二种机制下是sharp-P完全的，并提出了随机近似方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨无限持续时间游戏中节点控制权随机分配的复杂性，尤其是两种自然变体的影响，以扩展对这类游戏的理解。

Method: 研究了两种变体：(i) 节点首次访问时随机分配控制权，(ii) 游戏开始前通过独立硬币投掷分配。目标包括可达性、奇偶和能量目标，分析了计算获胜概率的复杂性。

Result: 定性问题是NL完全的；定量问题在第一种机制下是PSPACE完全的，第二种机制下是sharp-P完全的。提出了针对所有目标的随机近似方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明两种变体的复杂性不同，随机近似方案可以有效估计获胜概率，特别是在有限条件下。

Abstract: We study the complexity of solving two-player infinite duration games played on a fixed finite graph, where the control of a node is not predetermined but rather assigned randomly. In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.
