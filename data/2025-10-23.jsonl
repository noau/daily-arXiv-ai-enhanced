As\nagents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent\ntheir true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own\nchances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by\nguaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations\ncast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the\nperformance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate\nthe number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to\nwhat extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are\ngiven a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of\nnominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness\nof such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the\nmechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when\nthe prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents\nare to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a\nmechanism with consistency $1-O\\big(\\frac{1}{k}\\big)$ and robustness\n$1-\\frac{1}{e}-O\\big(\\frac{1}{k}\\big)$. For the special case of selecting a\nsingle agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that\n$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A\nclose comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal\nconsistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness."}

In\nstandard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to\nlearn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that\nagents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align\nexclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external\neffects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of\ncertain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the\nprincipal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across\nheterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e.,\nmaximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the\nprincipal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that\ncaptures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal\ndependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others;\n(2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning,\nthrough which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical\nguarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular\ndesirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness\nmeasures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit\ntradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort."}

To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of\nauctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed\nin the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding\nalgorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent\nevaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)\nautobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms\nfrom different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal\nformulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the\nmost recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately\nemulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use\ncases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising\ndrawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the\nevaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding\nalgorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice\nof metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where\nautobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners\nto evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives\nand select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets."}

It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods\nrequire vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial\npatterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood\nrelations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces\ndistortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to\nidentify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for\nassessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which\nhinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is\nparticularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single\nvisualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban\ncontexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a\nvisualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a\nfocus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering\napproaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and\nnewly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple\ncities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports\nusers in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,\nand identifying regions with high ordering distortions."}

Equipped with Martin-L\\\"{o}f style\ndependency, the session types of TLLC allow protocols to specify properties of\ncommunicated messages. When used in conjunction with the dependent type\nmachinery already present in TLL, dependent session types facilitate a form of\nrelational verification by relating concurrent programs with their idealized\nsequential counterparts. Correctness properties proven for sequential programs\ncan be easily lifted to their corresponding concurrent implementations. TLLC\nmakes session types a powerful tool for intrinsically verifying the correctness\nof data structures such as queues and concurrent algorithms such as map-reduce.\nTo extend TLL with session types, we develop a novel formulation of\nintuitionistic session type which we believe to be widely applicable for\nintegrating session types into other type systems beyond the context of TLLC.\nWe study the meta-theory of our language, proving its soundness as both a term\ncalculus and a process calculus. To demonstrate the practicality of TLLC, we\nhave implemented a prototype compiler that translates TLLC programs into\nconcurrent C code, which has been extensively evaluated."}

We demonstrate that all commonly studied\nvoting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of\n$\\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our\ninstance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of\n$\\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\\alpha$-JR is NP-complete.
