Abstract: We propose Probabilistic Inclusion Depth (PID) for the ensemble visualization of scalar fields. By introducing a probabilistic inclusion operator $\subset_{\!p}$, our method is a general data depth model supporting ensembles of fuzzy contours, such as soft masks from modern segmentation methods, and conventional ensembles of binary contours. We also advocate to extend contour extraction in scalar field ensembles to become a fuzzy decision by considering the probabilistic distribution of an isovalue to encode the sensitivity information. To reduce the complexity of the data depth computation, an efficient approximation using the mean probabilistic contour is devised. Furthermore, an order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved with an efficient parallel algorithm on the GPU. Our new method enables the computation of contour boxplots for ensembles of probabilistic masks, ensembles defined on various types of grids, and large 3D ensembles that are not studied by existing methods. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques on synthetic datasets, through examples of real-world ensemble datasets, and expert feedback.

### [2] [Sharing State Between Prompts and Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14805)
*Ellie Y. Cheng,Logan Weber,Tian Jin,Michael Carbin*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的编程抽象"共享程序状态"，用于实现自然语言代码与Python等正式语言的互操作性，并在Nightjar编程系统中实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起引入了自然语言编程，但实现自然语言代码与正式语言之间的互操作性需要大量手动工作，因此提出了共享程序状态的概念。

Method: 通过设计一种自然函数接口的方案，扩展编程系统以支持自然代码，并在此基础上实现共享程序状态。在Nightjar编程系统中应用该方法，允许程序员编写包含自然代码的Python程序。

Result: Nightjar程序在任务准确率上比手动实现高出4-19%，同时平均减少39.6%的代码行数，但可能会增加0.4-4.3倍的运行时开销。

Conclusion: 共享程序状态的抽象显著提高了自然语言编程的效率，尽管需要权衡运行时开销，但在减少代码量和提高准确性方面表现出色。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute.
  An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface.
  We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合广告拍卖框架JEANet，解决了传统方法无法兼顾联合与传统广告框架、忽视全球外部性和多方广告主竞价变异性等问题，通过自动化机制设计方法实现了高效率和高收益的广告位分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的联合广告方法难以同时支持联合与传统广告框架，且忽视全球外部性和多方广告主竞价变异性，限制了收益和通用性，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种联合拍卖框架JEANet，结合自动化机制设计（AMD）方法，动态适应多方广告主的竞价特性，并支持统一拍卖。

Result: 实验结果表明，JEANet在多槽联合拍卖中优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: JEANet是首个将全球外部性纳入联合拍卖的AMD方法，能够动态适应竞价特性并实现联合与传统广告的统一拍卖，显著提升了广告位分配的效率和收益。

Abstract: Recently, joint advertising has gained significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing the efficiency and revenue of advertising slot allocation. Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.
