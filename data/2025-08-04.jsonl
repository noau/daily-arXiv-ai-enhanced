Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory."}

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner.

Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the\ncommunity has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.\nHere, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a\npotentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic\nprogramming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be\nsynthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a\nconstraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In\nthis work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining\nnot just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To\ndemonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates\nand solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration\ntasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program\nspace, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time."}

In a bipartite\ngraph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching\nis defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any\nmatching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only\nthe vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem\nallowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have\npreferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings\nis how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires\nexponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we\nhave the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural\ncharacterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by\nmaximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are\nspecifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of\nthe popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the\nsame manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the\npopular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct\nconnection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three\nproblems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from\nthe other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular\nmatchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of\nthe two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the\ngraph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the\nmaximum-weight matching problem."}

Casey", "Edith Elkind"], "title": "Justified Representation: From Hare to Droop", "comment": null, "summary": "The study of proportionality in multiwinner voting with approval ballots has\nreceived much attention in recent years. Typically, proportionality is captured\nby variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive\ngroups of at least $\\ell\\cdot\\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number\nof voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\\ell$\nrepresentatives. The quantity $\\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the\nsocial choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the\nDroop quota, defined as $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{k+1}\\rfloor+1$. This quota is often\nused in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single\nTransferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's\nProportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of\napproval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The\ncontribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting\nrules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare\nquota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR,\nPJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of\nthis axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the\ncorresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it\nis necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult\nto satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the\nfrontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical\nresults with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models\nof voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard\n(Hare) JR/EJR+."}
