### [1] [PureSample: Neural Materials Learned by Sampling Microgeometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07240)
*Zixuan Li,Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PureSample是一种新颖的神经BRDF表示方法，通过随机行走采样学习材料行为，简化了传统复杂且模型特定的BRDF分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于物理的材料模型依赖于分析推导的BRDF，过程复杂且忽略空间变化。PureSample旨在简化这一过程，通过学习微观几何上的随机行走实现对材料行为的直接建模。

Method: 提出PureSample，通过两部分可学习组件实现：1）使用流匹配神经网络建模采样分布，支持重要性采样和PDF评估；2）引入视点相关反照率项，通过轻量级神经网络将标量PDF值转换为彩色BRDF值。

Result: 在多层材料、多散射微面材料等多种复杂材料上验证了PureSample的有效性，展示了其在高效率重要性采样、PDF评估和BRDF评估方面的优势。

Conclusion: PureSample提供了一种通用的神经BRDF表示方法，在复杂材料的建模和渲染中表现出高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Traditional physically-based material models rely on analytically derived
bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs), typically by
considering statistics of micro-primitives such as facets, flakes, or spheres,
sometimes combined with multi-bounce interactions such as layering and multiple
scattering. These derivations are often complex and model-specific, and
typically consider a statistical aggregate of a large surface area, ignoring
spatial variation. Once an analytic BRDF's evaluation is defined, one still
needs to design an importance sampling method for it, and a way to evaluate the
pdf of that sampling distribution, requiring further model-specific
derivations.
  We present PureSample: a novel neural BRDF representation that allows
learning a material's behavior purely by sampling forward random walks on the
microgeometry, which is usually straightforward to implement. Our
representation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and
BRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials.
  We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution
is modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance
sampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term,
captured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar
pdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions.
  We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered
materials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other
microstructures.

Abstract: The criteria for determining graph isomorphism are crucial for solving graph
isomorphism problems. The necessary condition is that two isomorphic graphs
possess invariants, but their function can only be used to filtrate and
subdivide candidate spaces. The sufficient conditions are used to rebuild the
isomorphic reconstruction of special graphs, but their drawback is that the
isomorphic functions of subgraphs may not form part of the isomorphic functions
of the parent graph. The use of sufficient or necessary conditions generally
results in backtracking to ensure the correctness of the decision algorithm.
The sufficient and necessary conditions can ensure that the determination of
graph isomorphism does not require backtracking, but the correctness of its
proof process is difficult to guarantee. This article proposes a verification
method that can correctly determine whether the judgment conditions proposed by
previous researchers are sufficient and necessary conditions. A subdivision
method has also been proposed in this article, which can obtain more
subdivisions for necessary conditions and effectively reduce the size of
backtracking space.

Conclusion: 神经顶点特征是一种有效的替代方案，能够显著优化内存效率并改进特征表示。

Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted
in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications.
However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial
memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing
hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized
formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving
explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features
throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh
vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured
representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory
efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with
the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural
representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis
on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces
memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based
representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering
inference overhead.

Abstract: The ability to engineer complex three-dimensional shapes from planar sheets
with precise, programmable control underpins emerging technologies in soft
robotics, reconfigurable devices, and functional materials. Here, we present a
reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a bilayer system
consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to
a kirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active
layer contracts while the patterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but
allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable 3D morphologies from simple
planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design and
scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that
captures the coupled mechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional
bilayer modeling, our framework collapses the multilayer composite into a
single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom and
enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel
energy formulation that captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch
and out-of-plane bending - extending beyond simple isotropic linear elastic
models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable fabrication
protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic
layer. The programmed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such
as bowls, canoes, and flower petals, all verified by both simulation and
physical prototypes.

### [5] [LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08228)
*Sining Lu,Guan Chen,Nam Anh Dinh,Itai Lang,Ari Holtzman,Rana Hanocka*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LL3M是一个多智能体系统，利用预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）通过编写可解释的Python代码在Blender中生成3D资产，改进了传统基于数据学习的生成方法，提供更高的模块化、可编辑性和艺术工作流集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D资产生成方法通常依赖大量3D数据学习，缺乏模块化和编辑性。LL3M旨在通过将形状生成重新定义为代码编写任务，提供更灵活、可解释且易于集成的工作流。

Method: LL3M通过协调多个专门的LLM智能体来规划、检索、编写、调试和优化Blender脚本，生成和编辑几何与外观。结合Blender API文档知识库（BlenderRAG），智能体能够执行高级建模操作并确保代码正确性。

Result: LL3M在多种形状类别、风格和材质编辑以及用户驱动的细化中表现出色，展示了代码作为生成和解释3D资产媒介的强大能力。

Conclusion: LL3M通过代码生成的方式，为3D资产创作提供了一种模块化、可编辑且可解释的新方法，支持智能体和用户的协同创作，推动了3D生成技术的发展。

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large
language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python
code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns
from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a
code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration
with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of
specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender
scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code
works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented
representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender
constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,
unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues
for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or
procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our
system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while
iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared
code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a
retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API
documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions
empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material
edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code
as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project

Conclusion: 本文为事件驱动程序提供了一种公理化语义方法，解决了复杂性并识别出可行片段，实验结果验证了方法的实用性。

Abstract: Event-driven programming is a popular paradigm where the flow of execution is
controlled by two features: (1) shared memory and (2) sending and receiving of
messages between multiple handler threads (just called handler). Each handler
has a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint
that the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by
different handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is
checking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of
event-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for
eventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as
execution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational
semantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,
resulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given
trace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem
and show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is
bounded. We then identify a tractable fragment: in the absence of nested
posting, where handlers do not post new messages while processing a message,
consistency checking can be performed in polynomial time. Finally, we implement
our approach in a prototype tool and report on experimental results on a wide
range of benchmarks.

### [7] [Generative Bid Shading in Real-Time Bidding Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06550)
*Yinqiu Huang,Hao Ma,Wenshuai Chen,Shuli Wang,Yongqiang Zhang,Xue Wei,Yinhua Zhu,Haitao Wang,Xingxing Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为生成式竞价阴影（GBS）的新方法，通过端到端生成模型和奖励偏好对齐系统，解决了现有竞价方法中的非凸问题和级联错误，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GBS通过创新的生成模型和奖励对齐系统，解决了现有竞价阴影方法的局限性，并在实际应用中展现了显著的优势。

Abstract: Bid shading plays a crucial role in Real-Time Bidding~(RTB) by adaptively
adjusting the bid to avoid advertisers overspending. Existing mainstream
two-stage methods, which first model bid landscapes and then optimize surplus
using operations research techniques, are constrained by unimodal assumptions
that fail to adapt for non-convex surplus curves and are vulnerable to
cascading errors in sequential workflows. Additionally, existing discretization
models of continuous values ignore the dependence between discrete intervals,
reducing the model's error correction ability, while sample selection bias in
bidding scenarios presents further challenges for prediction. To address these
issues, this paper introduces Generative Bid Shading~(GBS), which comprises two
primary components: (1) an end-to-end generative model that utilizes an
autoregressive approach to generate shading ratios by stepwise residuals,
capturing complex value dependencies without relying on predefined priors; and
(2) a reward preference alignment system, which incorporates a channel-aware
hierarchical dynamic network~(CHNet) as the reward model to extract
fine-grained features, along with modules for surplus optimization and
exploration utility reward alignment, ultimately optimizing both short-term and
long-term surplus using group relative policy optimization~(GRPO). Extensive
experiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness.
Moreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions
of bid requests daily.

### [9] [Asymmetric Network Games: $α$-Potential Function and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06619)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了网络游戏中的静态博弈，利用α-势函数框架，提出了玩家动作收敛到2α-纳什均衡的算法，并分析了网络不对称性对α的影响及社会福祉的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用α-势函数框架，假设行动集为紧区间且效用函数二次连续可微，推导了α-势函数的表达式，并提出了顺序最佳响应算法和同步梯度算法的改进版本。

Result: 在一定的假设下，改进的算法能够使玩家动作收敛到2α-纳什均衡，且α与网络的最大不对称性相关。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络博弈中玩家行为收敛和社会福祉提供了理论支持，并通过数值模拟验证了算法的有效性和均衡性质。

Abstract: In a network game, players interact over a network and the utility of each
player depends on his own action and on an aggregate of his neighbours'
actions. Many real world networks of interest are asymmetric and involve a
large number of heterogeneous players. This paper analyzes static network games
using the framework of $\alpha$-potential games. Under mild assumptions on the
action sets (compact intervals) and the utility functions (twice continuously
differentiable) of the players, we derive an expression for an inexact
potential function of the game, called the $\alpha$-potential function. Using
such a function, we show that modified versions of the sequential best-response
algorithm and the simultaneous gradient play algorithm achieve convergence of
players' actions to a $2\alpha$-Nash equilibrium. For linear-quadratic network
games, we show that $\alpha$ depends on the maximum asymmetry in the network
and is well-behaved for a wide range of networks of practical interest.
Further, we derive bounds on the social welfare of the $\alpha$-Nash
equilibrium corresponding to the maximum of the $\alpha$-potential function,
under suitable assumptions. We numerically illustrate the convergence of the
proposed algorithms and properties of the learned $2\alpha$-Nash equilibria.

### [10] [Convergence of Fast Policy Iteration in Markov Games and Robust MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06661)
*Keith Badger,Marek Petrik,Jefferson Huang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了马尔科夫游戏和鲁棒MDP中的Filar-Tolwinski（FT）算法，发现其可能无法收敛到鞍点，并提出了一种新的算法RCPI，保证收敛且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决马尔科夫游戏和鲁棒MDP中FT算法可能无法收敛的问题，提出了更可靠的算法RCPI。

Method: 提出了Residual Conditioned Policy Iteration（RCPI）算法，基于FT算法改进，并保证收敛到鞍点。

Result: 数值实验表明，RCPI的性能显著优于其他收敛算法，快了几个数量级。

Conclusion: RCPI作为一种改进算法，解决了FT的不收敛问题，并在性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Markov games and robust MDPs are closely related models that involve
computing a pair of saddle point policies. As part of the long-standing effort
to develop efficient algorithms for these models, the Filar-Tolwinski (FT)
algorithm has shown considerable promise. As our first contribution, we
demonstrate that FT may fail to converge to a saddle point and may loop
indefinitely, even in small games. This observation contradicts the proof of
FT's convergence to a saddle point in the original paper. As our second
contribution, we propose Residual Conditioned Policy Iteration (RCPI). RCPI
builds on FT, but is guaranteed to converge to a saddle point. Our numerical
results show that RCPI outperforms other convergent algorithms by several
orders of magnitude.

### [11] [Emergence of Cooperation and Commitment in Optional Prisoner's Dilemma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06702)
*Zhao Song,The Anh Han*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文通过两阶段博弈模型研究了在可选囚徒困境游戏中基于承诺的行为与合作的演变，发现自愿参与提升了承诺接受度但未能促进合作，且严格的制度激励更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了参与者自愿选择不参与的自由，限制了其在现实场景中的应用。论文旨在探讨自愿参与下承诺行为对合作的影响。

Method: 采用了两阶段博弈模型，第一阶段决定是否接受承诺，第二阶段根据承诺情况选择合作、背叛或退出，并比较了两种制度激励方法（STRICT-COM和FLEXIBLE-COM）的效果。

Result: 研究发现自愿参与提高了承诺接受度但未促进合作，严格的制度激励更有利于合作，而灵活的激励在特定场景下能提升社会福利。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了单纯依赖自愿参与和承诺无法有效解决社会困境，强调了设计良好的制度激励对促进合作和社会福利的重要性。

Abstract: Commitment is a well-established mechanism for fostering cooperation in human
society and multi-agent systems. However, existing research has predominantly
focused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from
an interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where
participation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game
model to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and
cooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In
the pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once
in the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on
the formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation
boosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead
to widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare
two institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that
rewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible
one (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the
game. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better
for promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an
opportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient
alternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour
results in a high gain. This study highlights the limitations of relying solely
on voluntary participation and commitment to resolving social dilemmas,
emphasising the importance of well-designed institutional incentives to promote
cooperation and social welfare effectively.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 自私路由在拥堵网络中的低效是算法博弈论中的经典问题，本文研究通过自动驾驶车辆的集中分配路线是否解决这一低效，并发现竞争是实现最优结果的必要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车辆能否通过集中分配路线消除自私路由的低效，同时考虑到个体激励和实践中的多代理竞争。

Method: 设计了一个接受竞争的路由机制，从经典的Pigou网络为基础案例出发，引导路线分配收敛到最优状态。

Result: 研究发现竞争是实现最优交通分配的必要条件，设计的机制能够收敛到最优分配状态。

Conclusion: 竞争不仅不是障碍，反而是实现交通分配最优化的关键因素；通过设计合适的机制，可以克服自私路由的低效问题。

Abstract: The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical
problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy
(i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of
a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles,
capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to
ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance,
a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and
instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision
overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle
has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g.,
different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such
competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving
optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces
competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical
Pigou network as a foundational case.

*Ivan Geffner,Caspar Oesterheld,Vincent Conitzer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了一种分阶段承诺协议，解决了传统一次性承诺博弈中因囚徒困境效应导致的效率低下问题，恢复了侧支付的效率潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的博弈模型中，一次性无限制的承诺可能导致效率低下的均衡，即使存在帕累托最优的纳什均衡。

Method: 提出了一种分阶段承诺协议，允许玩家在多轮中以小额、有限的增量承诺转移，且每轮需一致同意才能继续。

Result: 该协议实现了从任何有限博弈出发，严格帕累托改进非退化纳什均衡的福利最大化支付配置。

Conclusion: 分阶段且有限的承诺能够避免传统模型中的效率低下问题，恢复了侧支付的效率潜力。

Abstract: We examine normal-form games in which players may \emph{pre-commit} to
outcome-contingent transfers before choosing their actions. In the one-shot
version of this model, Jackson and Wilkie showed that side contracting can
backfire: even a game with a Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium can devolve into
inefficient equilibria once unbounded, simultaneous commitments are allowed.
The root cause is a prisoner's dilemma effect, where each player can exploit
her commitment power to reshape the equilibrium in her favor, harming overall
welfare.
  To circumvent this problem we introduce a \emph{staged-commitment} protocol.
Players may pledge transfers only in small, capped increments over multiple
rounds, and the phase continues only with unanimous consent. We prove that,
starting from any finite game $\Gamma$ with a non-degenerate Nash equilibrium
$\vec{\sigma}$, this protocol implements every welfare-maximizing payoff
profile that \emph{strictly} Pareto-improves $\vec{\sigma}$. Thus, gradual and
bounded commitments restore the full efficiency potential of side payments
while avoiding the inefficiencies identified by Jackson and Wilkie.

*Hang Ren,Xiaozhen Sun,Tianzi Ma,Jiajia Zhang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的适应性遗憾最小化算法，用于计算近似EFPE，解决了现有方法在计算成本、近似误差和收敛速度上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EFPE算法存在计算成本高、近似误差大和固定扰动导致的收敛问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Reward Transformation Counterfactual Regret Minimization (RTCFR)算法和动态调整扰动的新度量ISNE。

Result: 理论分析确认了EFPE的收敛性，实验结果表明该方法在NE和EFPE查找任务中优于现有算法。

Conclusion: RTCFR算法和ISNE度量的结合显著提升了EFPE的计算效率和精度。

Abstract: The Nash Equilibrium (NE) assumes rational play in imperfect-information
Extensive-Form Games (EFGs) but fails to ensure optimal strategies for
off-equilibrium branches of the game tree, potentially leading to suboptimal
outcomes in practical settings. To address this, the Extensive-Form Perfect
Equilibrium (EFPE), a refinement of NE, introduces controlled perturbations to
model potential player errors. However, existing EFPE-finding algorithms, which
typically rely on average strategy convergence and fixed perturbations, face
significant limitations: computing average strategies incurs high computational
costs and approximation errors, while fixed perturbations create a trade-off
between NE approximation accuracy and the convergence rate of NE refinements.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose an efficient adaptive regret
minimization algorithm for computing approximate EFPE, achieving last-iterate
convergence in two-player zero-sum EFGs. Our approach introduces Reward
Transformation Counterfactual Regret Minimization (RTCFR) to solve perturbed
games and defines a novel metric, the Information Set Nash Equilibrium (ISNE),
to dynamically adjust perturbations. Theoretical analysis confirms convergence
to EFPE, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both NE and EFPE-finding tasks.

preference over two obnoxious facilities, and there is a minimum distance
constraint d between the two facilities. Each agent wants to be as far away as
possible from the facilities that affect her, and the utility of each agent is
the total distance from her to these facilities. The goal is to decide how to
place the facilities in [0, 1] so as to incentivize agents to report their
private locations truthfully as well as maximize the social utility. First, we
consider the special setting where d = 0, that is, the two facilities can be
located at any point in [0, 1]. We propose a deterministic strategyproof
mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4 and a randomized strategyproof
mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 2, respectively. Then we study
the general setting. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with
approximation ratio of at most 8 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with
approximation ratio of at most 4, respectively. Furthermore, we provide lower
bounds of 2 and 14/13 on the approximation ratio for any deterministic and any
randomized strategyproof mechanism, respectively.

Motivation: 在分布式异构环境中，代理位置信息私密且分组的情况下，如何设计策略证明机制以真实获取代理位置并优化社会目标是该研究的核心动机。

Method: 采用分布式机制设计，分为两步：每组基于代理报告选择两个候选位置作为代表；然后从所有代表中选择两个设施位置。研究确定性策略证明机制，分析四种社会目标下的失真上下界。

Result: 在四种社会目标（Average-of-Average、Max-of-Max、Average-of-Max 和 Max-of-Average）下，获得了恒定的失真上下界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，确定性策略证明分布式机制能在受限设施选址问题中有效激励代理真实报告，并在多种社会目标下实现近似优化。

Abstract: We study a constrained distributed heterogeneous two-facility location
problem, where a set of agents with private locations on the real line are
divided into disjoint groups. The constraint means that the facilities can only
be built in a given multiset of candidate locations and at most one facility
can be built at each candidate location. Given the locations of the two
facilities, the cost of an agent is the distance from her location to the
farthest facility (referred to as max-variant). Our goal is to design
strategyproof distributed mechanisms that can incentivize all agents to
truthfully report their locations and approximately optimize some social
objective. A distributed mechanism consists of two steps: for each group, the
mechanism chooses two candidate locations as the representatives of the group
based only on the locations reported by agents therein; then, it outputs two
facility locations among all the representatives. We focus on a class of
deterministic strategyproof distributed mechanisms and analyze upper and lower
bounds on the distortion under the Average-of-Average cost (average of the
average individual cost of agents in each group), the Max-of-Max cost (maximum
individual cost among all agents), the Average-of-Max cost (average of the
maximum individual cost among all agents in each group) and the Max-of-Average
cost (maximum of the average individual cost of all agents in each group).
Under four social objectives, we obtain constant upper and lower distortion
bounds.
