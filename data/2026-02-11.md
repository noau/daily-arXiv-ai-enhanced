Abstract: We examine the complexity of computing welfare- and revenue-maximizing equilibria in autobidding second-price auctions subject to return-on-spend (RoS) constraints. We show that computing an autobidding equilibrium that approximates the welfare-optimal one within a factor of $2 - ε$ is NP-hard for any constant $ε> 0$. Moreover, deciding whether there exists an autobidding equilibrium that attains a $1/2 + ε$ fraction of the optimal welfare -- unfettered by equilibrium constraints -- is NP-hard for any constant $ε> 0$. This hardness result is tight in view of the fact that the price of anarchy (PoA) is at most $2$, and shows that deciding whether a non-trivial autobidding equilibrium exists -- one that is even marginally better than the worst-case guarantee -- is intractable. For revenue, we establish a stronger logarithmic inapproximability, while under the projection games conjecture, our reduction rules out even a polynomial approximation factor. These results significantly strengthen the APX-hardness of Li and Tang (AAAI '24). Furthermore, we refine our reduction in the presence of ML advice concerning the buyers' valuations, revealing again a close connection between the inapproximability threshold and PoA bounds. Finally, we examine relaxed notions of equilibrium attained by simple learning algorithms, establishing constant inapproximability for both revenue and welfare.

Abstract: As autobidding systems increasingly dominate online advertising auctions, characterizing their long-term dynamical behavior is brought to the fore. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of autobidders who optimize value subject to a return-on-spend (RoS) constraint under uniform bid scaling. Our main set of results show that simple autobidding dynamics can exhibit formally chaotic behavior. This significantly strengthens the recent results of Leme, Piliouras, Schneider, Spendlove, and Zuo (EC '24) that went as far as quasiperiodicity. Our proof proceeds by establishing that autobidding dynamics can simulate -- up to an arbitrarily small error -- a broad class of continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. This class contains as a special case Chua's circuit, a classic chaotic system renowned for its iconic double scroll attractor. Our reduction develops several modular gadgets, which we anticipate will find other applications going forward. Moreover, in discrete time, we show that different incarnations of mirror descent can exhibit Li-Yorke chaos, topological transitivity, and sensitivity to initial conditions, connecting along the way those dynamics to classic dynamical systems such as the logistic map and the Ricker population model. Taken together, our results reveal that the long-term behavior of ostensibly simple second-price autobidding auctions can be inherently unpredictable and complex.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在差异隐私下，有异构隐私成本的代理人如何形成数据共享联盟，分析了隐私选择对均衡结果的影响及与集中化最优基准的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理人拥有敏感数据，需决定是否加入数据共享联盟及添加多少噪声。隐私选择引发了成本与数据效用间的权衡，并产生外部性，导致参与和隐私水平具有策略性。

Method: 通过均衡分析，研究不同隐私成本制度下的稳定联盟和隐私选择，包括纳什均衡和更宽松的鲁棒均衡，并对比集中化最优基准的效率。

Result: 研究显示均衡结果可能不存在或非单调，鲁棒均衡能更广泛存在；效率和估计准确性取决于参与者数量、成本特性和隐私成本规模。

Conclusion: 隐私选择对外部性和均衡结果有显著影响；鲁棒均衡提供了更广泛的均衡存在性；效率和准确性依赖于多种因素。

Abstract: We study coalition formation for data sharing under differential privacy when agents have heterogeneous privacy costs. Each agent holds a sensitive data point and decides whether to participate in a data-sharing coalition and how much noise to add to their data. Privacy choices induce a fundamental trade-off: higher privacy reduces individual data-sharing costs but degrades data utility and statistical accuracy for the coalition. These choices generate externalities across agents, making both participation and privacy levels strategic. Our goal is to understand which coalitions are stable, how privacy choices shape equilibrium outcomes, and how decentralized data sharing compares to a centralized, socially optimal benchmark.
  We provide a comprehensive equilibrium analysis across a broad range of privacy-cost regimes, from decreasing costs (e.g., privacy amplification from pooling data) to increasing costs (e.g., greater exposure to privacy attacks in larger coalitions). We first characterize Nash equilibrium coalitions with endogenous privacy levels and show that equilibria may fail to exist and can be non-monotonic in problem parameters. We also introduce a weaker equilibrium notion called robust equilibrium (that allows more widespread equilibrium existence by equipping existing players in the coalition with the power to prevent or veto external players from joining) and fully characterize such equilibria. Finally, we analyze, for both Nash and robust equilibria, the efficiency relative to the social optimum in terms of social welfare and estimator accuracy. We derive bounds that depend sharply on the number of players, properties of the cost profile and how privacy costs scale with coalition size.

### [4] [Enhancing Affine Maximizer Auctions with Correlation-Aware Payment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09455)
*Haoran Sun,Xuanzhi Xia,Xu Chu,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的相关性感知AMA（CA-AMA）框架，通过引入相关性感知支付，弥补了传统AMA在估值相关分布中的表达能力不足问题。CA-AMA保留了DSIC特性，并能通过优化算法实现近似最优收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的AMA（Affine Maximizer Auctions）由于支付形式的固定性，在投标者估值相关的分布中表达能力受限。因此，需要一种新的框架来增强AMA的表达能力，同时保留其优势特性（如DSIC和IR）。

Method: 本文提出了CA-AMA框架，其核心是引入相关性感知支付。通过形式化为约束优化问题，并在IR约束下优化CA-AMA。此外，设计了一种实用的两阶段训练算法来优化CA-AMA。

Result: 理论分析表明，传统AMA在某些情景下的表现可能远逊于最优收入，而CA-AMA能达到最优收入。实验证明，所提出的算法能在多种分布中找到近似最优的CA-AMA，提高收入并降低对IR的违反程度。

Conclusion: CA-AMA框架通过相关性感知支付显著提升了AMA的表达能力和收入表现，同时保持了DSIC特性。优化的两阶段算法在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), a generalized mechanism family from VCG, are widely used in automated mechanism design due to their inherent dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR). However, as the payment form is fixed, AMA's expressiveness is restricted, especially in distributions where bidders' valuations are correlated. In this paper, we propose Correlation-Aware AMA (CA-AMA), a novel framework that augments AMA with a new correlation-aware payment. We show that any CA-AMA preserves the DSIC property and formalize finding optimal CA-AMA as a constraint optimization problem subject to the IR constraint. Then, we theoretically characterize scenarios where classic AMAs can perform arbitrarily poorly compared to the optimal revenue, while the CA-AMA can reach the optimal revenue. For optimizing CA-AMA, we design a practical two-stage training algorithm. We derive that the target function's continuity and the generalization bound on the degree of deviation from strict IR. Finally, extensive experiments showcase that our algorithm can find an approximate optimal CA-AMA in various distributions with improved revenue and a low degree of violation of IR.

### [5] [Routing, Cascades, and User Choice for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09902)
*Rafid Mahmood*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了LLM提供商如何基于任务难度和延迟路由用户任务，分析了用户行为对路由策略的影响，并提出了一种博弈模型以优化提供商和用户的利益冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM提供商在性能和成本之间的权衡，以及用户行为对路由策略的影响，旨在优化双方的利益。

Method: 提出了一种Stackelberg博弈模型，其中LLM提供商与用户交互，通过完全描述用户的最佳响应和简化提供商问题来解决博弈。

Result: 研究发现，最优路由策略通常为静态策略，且当用户和提供商对模型的效用和成本排名不同时，存在利益不一致的差距。极端情况下，提供商会通过延迟模型来降低成本，影响用户效用。

Conclusion: 研究为单提供商和单用户的交互提供了简单的阈值规则，并明确了路由、级联和延迟策略的适用条件及其影响。

Abstract: To mitigate the trade-offs between performance and costs, LLM providers route user tasks to different models based on task difficulty and latency. We study the effect of LLM routing with respect to user behavior. We propose a game between an LLM provider with two models (standard and reasoning) and a user who can re-prompt or abandon tasks if the routed model cannot solve them. The user's goal is to maximize their utility minus the delay from using the model, while the provider minimizes the cost of servicing the user. We solve this Stackelberg game by fully characterizing the user best response and simplifying the provider problem. We observe that in nearly all cases, the optimal routing policy involves a static policy with no cascading that depends on the expected utility of the models to the user. Furthermore, we reveal a misalignment gap between the provider-optimal and user-preferred routes when the user's and provider's rankings of the models with respect to utility and cost differ. Finally, we demonstrate conditions for extreme misalignment where providers are incentivized to throttle the latency of the models to minimize their costs, consequently depressing user utility. The results yield simple threshold rules for single-provider, single-user interactions and clarify when routing, cascading, and throttling help or harm.

### [6] [The Architecture of Illusion: Network Opacity and Strategic Escalation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10053)
*Raman Ebrahimi,Sepehr Ilami,Babak Heydari,Isabel Trevino,Massimo Franceschetti*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了“Connected Minds”模型，通过引入网络偏差参数$p$，统一了认知层级模型和Level-$k$模型，展示了网络透明度如何影响代理人的行为和均衡结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的有界理性模型假设代理人要么准确了解群体的推理能力（认知层级模型），要么持有固执的信念（Level-$k$模型）。作者提出新模型，旨在统一这两种框架，并探讨网络透明度对代理人行为的影响。

Method: 论文引入“Connected Minds”模型，通过参数化的网络偏差（参数$p$）整合迭代推理。$p$代表网络透明度，范围从0（完全不透明）到1（完全透明）。模型在不同$p$值下分别退化为Level-$k$模型和认知层级模型。

Result: 研究发现，网络不透明会导致代理人系统性地高估对手的认知深度（Sophisticated Bias）。在战略互补游戏中，限制信息可以最大化总体努力（Escalation Principle）；而在协调游戏中，最大化网络透明度能减少方差并稳定结果（Transparency Reversal）。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑结构形如认知变焦镜头，决定代理人是表现为局部模仿者还是全局优化者。研究结果表明，网络透明度是一个可操作的杠杆，可以通过调整$p$值来影响均衡行为。

Abstract: Standard models of bounded rationality typically assume agents either possess accurate knowledge of the population's reasoning abilities (Cognitive Hierarchy) or hold dogmatic, degenerate beliefs (Level-$k$). We introduce the ``Connected Minds'' model, which unifies these frameworks by integrating iterative reasoning with a parameterized network bias. We posit that agents do not observe the global population; rather, they observe a sample biased by their network position, governed by a locality parameter $p$ representing algorithmic ranking, social homophily, or information disclosure. We show that this parameter acts as a continuous bridge: the model collapses to the myopic Level-$k$ recursion as networks become opaque ($p \to 0$) and recovers the standard Cognitive Hierarchy model under full transparency ($p=1$). Theoretically, we establish that network opacity induces a \emph{Sophisticated Bias}, causing agents to systematically overestimate the cognitive depth of their opponents while preserving the log-concavity of belief distributions. This makes $p$ an actionable lever: a planner or platform can tune transparency -- globally or by segment (a personalized $p_k$) -- to shape equilibrium behavior. From a mechanism design perspective, we derive the \emph{Escalation Principle}: in games of strategic complements, restricting information can maximize aggregate effort by trapping agents in echo chambers where they compete against hallucinated, high-sophistication peers. Conversely, we identify a \emph{Transparency Reversal} for coordination games, where maximizing network visibility is required to minimize variance and stabilize outcomes. Our results suggest that network topology functions as a cognitive zoom lens, determining whether agents behave as local imitators or global optimizers.

Conclusion: 分配比例性是一个有效的度量标准，可以用于评估和比较多赢家选举规则的比例性表现。

Abstract: While proportionality is frequently named as a desirable property of voting rules, its interpretation in multiwinner voting differs significantly from that in apportionment. We aim to bridge these two distinct notions of proportionality by introducing the concept of allocation proportionality, founded upon the framework of party elections, where each candidate in a multiwinner election is assigned to a party. A voting rule is allocation proportional if each party's share of elected candidates equals that party's aggregate score. Recognizing that no committee scoring rule can universally satisfy allocation proportionality in practice, we introduce a new measure of allocation proportionality degree and discuss how it relates to other quantitative measures of proportionality. This measure allows us to compare OWA-based committee scoring rules according to how much they diverge from the ideal of allocation proportionality. We present experimental results for several common rules: SNTV, $k$-Borda, Chamberlin-Courant, Harmonic Borda, Proportional $k$-Approval Voting, and Bloc Voting.

### [8] [The Complexity of Proper Equilibrium in Extensive-Form and Polytope Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10096)
*Brian Hu Zhang,Ioannis Anagnostides,Kiriaki Fragkia,Maria-Florina Balcan,Tuomas Sandholm*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文解决了长期悬而未决的问题，确定了在扩展形式博弈（EFGs）中计算正常形式proper均衡的PPAD-和FIXP$_a$-完全性问题，并展示了一种高效计算的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myerson（1978）提出的proper均衡被视为Nash均衡的经典改进，但其在扩展形式博弈中的复杂性一直未解。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过一种技术高效计算受扰的（proper）最优响应，尽管经典的基于permutahedron的扰动方法在贝叶斯博弈中是#P-难的。

Result: 证明了在双人和多人扩展形式博弈中计算proper均衡的PPAD-和FIXP$_a$-完全性，同时揭示在polytope博弈中计算proper均衡是NP-难的。

Conclusion: 本文首次揭示了计算均衡改进的复杂性在某些自然类中不会崩溃到Nash均衡的复杂性，且polytope博弈中的均衡计算相较于扩展形式博弈更为困难。

Abstract: The proper equilibrium, introduced by Myerson (1978), is a classic refinement of the Nash equilibrium that has been referred to as the "mother of all refinements." For normal-form games, computing a proper equilibrium is known to be PPAD-complete for two-player games and FIXP$_a$-complete for games with at least three players. However, the complexity beyond normal-form games -- in particular, for extensive-form games (EFGs) -- was a long-standing open problem first highlighted by Miltersen and Sørensen (SODA '08). In this paper, we resolve this problem by establishing PPAD- and FIXP$_a$-membership (and hence completeness) of normal-form proper equilibria in two-player and multi-player EFGs respectively. Our main ingredient is a technique for computing a perturbed (proper) best response that can be computed efficiently in EFGs. This is despite the fact that, as we show, computing a best response using the classic perturbation of Kohlberg and Mertens based on the permutahedron is #P-hard even in Bayesian games. In stark contrast, we show that computing a proper equilibrium in polytope games is NP-hard. This marks the first natural class in which the complexity of computing equilibrium refinements does not collapse to that of Nash equilibria, and the first problem in which equilibrium computation in polytope games is strictly harder -- unless there is a collapse in the complexity hierarchy -- relative to extensive-form games.
