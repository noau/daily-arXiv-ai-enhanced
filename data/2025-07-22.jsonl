Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene\n(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,\nimplicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the\nscene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications."}

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value.

Consequently, BaSL can model\nprobabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised\ndistribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and\nimproper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of\nBaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via\n$\\sigma$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of\nHoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL\nbased on the category of $s$-finite kernels. Using BaSL, we then prove\nproperties of statistical models such as the expected value of Bayesian coin\nflip, correlation of random variables in the collider Bayesian network, and the\nposterior distributions of the burglar alarm model, a parameter estimation\nalgorithm, and the Gaussian mixture model."}

As PLC applications become increasingly\ncomplex, ensuring their correctness is crucial. Existing formal verification\ntechniques focus on individual PLC programs in isolation, often neglecting\ninteractions with physical environments and network communication between\ncontrollers. This limitation poses significant challenges in analyzing\nreal-world industrial systems, where continuous dynamics and communication\ndelays play a critical role. In this paper, we present a unified formal\nframework that integrates discrete PLC semantics, networked communication, and\ncontinuous physical behaviors. To mitigate state explosion, we apply partial\norder reduction, significantly reducing the number of explored states while\nmaintaining correctness. Our framework enables precise analysis of PLC-driven\nsystems with continuous dynamics and networked communication."}

Abstract machines rely on similar and yet different concepts of\nclosures and environments.\n  In this paper, we study the relationship between the two approaches. We adopt\na very simple {\\lambda}-calculus with tuples as source language and study\nabstract machines for both the source language and the target of closure\nconversion. Moreover, we focus on the simple case of flat\nclosures/environments, that is, with no sharing of environments. We provide\nthree contributions.\n  Firstly, a new simple proof technique for the correctness of closure\nconversion, inspired by abstract machines.\n  Secondly, we show how the closure invariants of the target language allow us\nto design a new way of handling environments in abstract machines, not\nsuffering the shortcomings of other styles.\n  Thirdly, we study the machines from the point of view of time complexity,\nadapting analyses by Accattoli and co-authors. We show that closure conversion\ndecreases various dynamic costs while increasing the size of the initial code.\nDespite these changes, the overall complexity of the machines before and after\nclosure conversion turns out to be the same."}
