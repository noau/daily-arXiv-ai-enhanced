Kostylev", "Martin Giese", "Einar Broch Johnsen"], "title": "Semantically Reflected Programs", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper addresses the dichotomy between the formalization of structural\nand the formalization of behavioral knowledge by means of semantically lifted\nprograms, which explore an intuitive connection between programs and knowledge\ngraphs. While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent\nformal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming\nlanguages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this\ndichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an\nexecuting program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming\nlanguage. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within\nthe programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the\napplication domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic\nlifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain\nthe operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and\nvirtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection\nlayer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case\nstudy of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the\ntechnique. The language implementation is open source and available online."}

A practical consequence of these\ndynamics is the \\textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's\nstrategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies\non $\\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients\nwith respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data\ndistribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the\nresulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\\beta$\nunobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based\nsensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced\ndistribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees\nfor performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of\nstrong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated\nretraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the\nsensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable\nequilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction\nerror minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game\nshow that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower\nlosses and faster convergence."}

Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address\nsparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,\nas well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of\nstates and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with\ngeneration uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between\nadjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss\nof ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a\nhighly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal\nauto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed\nCBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random\nvariable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the\ngoal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated\nsequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model\nto refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'\nobjectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our\napproach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding\nbenchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging\nsparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on\nthe Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target\ncost."}
