Starting with a Phong map continuously assigning normals to all points on the mesh, we define an extrinsic bases for continuous tangent vector fields by using the Rodrigues rotation to transport tangent vectors assigned to vertices to tangent vectors in the interiors of the triangles. As our vector fields are continuous and weakly differentiable, we can use them to define a covariant derivative field that is evaluatable almost-everywhere on the mesh. Decomposing the covariant derivative in terms of diagonal multiple of the identity, anti-symmetric, and trace-less symmetric components, we can define the standard operators used for vector field processing including the Hodge Laplacian energy, Connection Laplacian energy, and Killing energy. Additionally, the ability to perform point-wise evaluation of the covariant derivative also makes it possible for us to define the Lie bracket."}

Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes. These findings establish that converting tokenomics from static rules into continuous, structurally constrained control loops is a necessary condition for secure and sustainable decentralized intelligence networks."}

Cary, NC", "summary": "Variable scoping dictates how and where variables are accessible within programming languages, playing a crucial role in code efficiency and organization. This paper examines the distinct scoping rules in SAS and R, focusing on SAS's dynamic scoping and R's lexical scoping. In SAS, dynamic scoping utilizes symbol tables, resolving variables at runtime by dynamically searching through active macro layers. R, in contrast, employs lexical scoping, using environments to resolve variables based on the structure in which functions are defined. Illustrative examples highlight the differences between these scoping strategies, showcasing their impact on code behavior. Additionally, the paper outlines methods for inspecting variables in SAS's symbol tables and R's environments, offering practical insights for debugging and optimization. Strategies for controlling variable scope in both languages are discussed, enhancing code precision and reliability. This exploration equips programmers with critical understanding to optimize variable management, improving their programming practices in SAS and R."}

In this work, we investigate the following complementary formulations of inverse game-theoretic learning: (i) a Closed-form Correlated Equilibrium Maximum-Likelihood estimator (CE-ML) specialized for $2\\times2$ games; and (ii) a Logit Best Response Maximum-Likelihood estimator (LBR-ML) that captures long-run adaptation dynamics via stochastic response processes. Together, these approaches span the spectrum between static equilibrium consistency and dynamic behavioral realism. We evaluate them on synthetic \"chicken-dare\" games and traffic-interaction scenarios simulated in SUMO, comparing parameter recovery and distributional fit. Results reveal clear trade-offs between interpretability, computational tractability, and behavioral expressiveness across models."}

Cary, NC: SouthEast SAS Users Group", "summary": "Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can optimize code execution by deferring evaluations until their results are required, thus enhancing efficiency. In most modern programming languages, like R, lazy evaluation is commonly applied to function arguments. However, the application of lazy evaluation in SAS has not been extensively explored. This paper focuses on the mechanisms of lazy evaluation in SAS MACROs and R functions, offering a comparative analysis of the underlying principles that drive these processes.\n  R's lazy evaluation is driven by a data structure called Promise, which postpones evaluation and does not occupy memory until the value is needed, utilizing a call-by-need strategy. SAS, on the other hand, achieves lazy evaluation through its symbol tables, employing memory to store parameters, and operates on a call-by-name basis. These discrepancies in lazy evaluation strategies can notably impact the results of R functions and SAS MACROs. By examining these distinct approaches, the paper illuminates the impact of lazy evaluation on programming efficiency, supported by illustrative examples. As the shift from SAS to R becomes increasingly prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry, understanding these techniques enables programmers to optimize their code for greater efficacy. This exploration serves as a guide to enhance programming capabilities and performance in both languages."}

To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems."}
