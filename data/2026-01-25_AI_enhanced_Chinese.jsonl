Evidence from norm elicitations in two canonical economic games", "comment": null, "summary": "While delegating tasks to large language models (LLMs) can save people time, there is growing evidence that offloading tasks to such models produces social costs. We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u8868\u4eba\u4eec\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u65f6\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u7531\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u65e0\u53cd\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u59d4\u6258\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u671f\u671b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6e38\u620f\uff08\u72ec\u88c1\u8005\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u7252\u6e38\u620f\uff09\u4ee5\u53caKrupka-Weber\u89c4\u8303\u5f15\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528\u82f1\u56fd\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff08N = 2,658\uff09\u3002", "result": "1. \u673a\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u9002\uff1b2. \u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u62d2\u7edd\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\uff1b3. \u673a\u5668\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u65e0\u53cd\u611f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u673a\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6210\u5206\u3002"}}

Given a game with empty core, we look for the closest balanced game, in the sense of the (weighted) Euclidean distance, i.e., the orthogonal projection of the game on the set of balanced games. Besides an analytical approach which becomes rapidly intractable, we propose a fast algorithm to find the closest balanced game, avoiding exponential complexity for the optimization problem, and being able to run up to 20 players. We show experimentally that the probability that the closest game has a core reduced to a singleton tends to 1 when the number of players grow. We provide a mathematical proof that the proportion of facets whose games have a non-singleton core tends to 0 when the number of players grow, by finding an expression of the aymptotic growth of the number of minimal balanced collections. This permits to prove mathematically the experimental result. Consequently, taking the core of the projected game defines a new solution concept, which we call least square core due to its analogy with the least core, and our result shows that the probability that this is a point solution tends to 1 when the number of players grow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3a\u7a7a\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u5e73\u8861\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5355\u70b9\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3a\u7a7a\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u627e\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u591a20\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5355\u70b9\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u5e73\u8861\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5355\u70b9\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5355\u70b9\u89e3\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u9762\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u968f\u7740\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u89e3\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5355\u70b9\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\u3002"}}

Success thus depends on efficiently allocating limited resources. However, empirical demonstration has been difficult because effort allocation is rarely observable and feedback is often delayed, limiting our understanding of expertise. Professional tennis provides an ideal natural experiment. Because each game resets after a player wins four points and points in a lost game are wasted, the value of a point varies sharply across scores. Efficient allocation should therefore win games without wasting points, conserving resources for future games. Such allocation manifests in score-dependent point-winning probabilities, from which we derive each player's Pareto frontier-the theoretical limit of the trade-off between game-winning probability and the expected points per game. Here, we show that top players operate closer to this frontier, converting points to game wins more efficiently. Optimal strategies reduce the probability of winning points when the player is far behind (e.g.,0-2, 0-3). This behavior is psychologically difficult-letting go of the current game-but represents a rational energy conservation strategy. Top players exhibit this pattern especially in return games, where winning points is harder than in service games, requiring them to drastically vary their efforts, consistent with game-theoretic predictions. These findings suggest that elite performance reflects efficient adaptation to rule-created value structures; knowing when to give up may be as fundamental to expertise as knowing when to compete.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9876\u7ea7\u7f51\u7403\u9009\u624b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6bd4\u5206\u53d8\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6bd4\u5206\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u83b7\u80dc\u70b9\u6570\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u4f53\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a5\u53d1\u7403\u5c40\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u4f7f\u5f97\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u523b\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u914d\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e14\u53cd\u9988\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9009\u62e9\u804c\u4e1a\u7f51\u7403\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9009\u624b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fb9\u754c\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5728\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u548c\u6bcf\u5c40\u9884\u671f\u5f97\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8003\u5bdf\u9009\u624b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u5206\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9876\u7ea7\u9009\u624b\u5728\u6bd4\u5206\u843d\u540e\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u83b7\u80dc\u70b9\u6570\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u63a5\u53d1\u7403\u5c40\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7b26\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u82f1\u8868\u73b0\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c4\u5219\u521b\u9020\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u77e5\u9053\u4f55\u65f6\u653e\u5f03\u4e0e\u77e5\u9053\u4f55\u65f6\u7ade\u4e89\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002"}}

While prior work largely focuses on unconstrained contracts that allow heterogeneous payments across agents, many real-world environments limit payment dispersion. Motivated by this, we study equal-pay contracts, where all agents receive identical payments. Our results also extend to nearly-equal-pay contracts where any two payments are identical up to a constant factor.\n  We provide both algorithmic and hardness results across a broad hierarchy of reward functions, under both binary and combinatorial action models. While we focus on equal-pay contracts, our analysis also yields new insights into unconstrained contract design, and resolves two important open problems. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time O(1)-approximation algorithms for (i) submodular rewards under combinatorial actions, and (ii) XOS rewards under binary actions. These guarantees are tight: We rule out the existence of (i) a PTAS for combinatorial actions, even for gross substitutes rewards (unless P = NP), and (ii) any O(1)-approximation for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions. Crucially, our hardness results hold even for unconstrained contracts, thereby settling the corresponding open problems in this setting.\n  Finally, we quantify the loss induced by fairness via the price of equality, defined as the worst-case ratio between the optimal principal's utility achievable by unconstrained contracts and that achievable by equal-pay contracts. We obtain a bound of $\u0398(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents.

Most parliaments are assembled using apportionment methods that distribute the seats based on the parties' vote counts. Common apportionment methods include divisor sequence methods (like D'Hondt or Sainte-Lagu\u00eb), the largest-remainder method, and first-past-the-post. In many countries, an electoral threshold is implemented to prevent very small parties from entering the parliament. Further, several countries have apportionment systems that incorporate multiple districts. We study how computationally hard it is to change the election outcome (i.e., to increase or limit the influence of a distinguished party) by convincing a limited number of voters to change their vote. We refer to these bribery-style attacks as \\emph{strategic campaigns} and study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational (both classical and parameterized) complexity. We also run extensive experiments on real-world election data and study the effectiveness of optimal campaigns, in particular as opposed to using heuristic bribing strategies and with respect to the influence of the threshold and the influence of the number of districts. For apportionment elections with threshold, finally, we propose -- as an alternative to the standard top-choice mode -- the second-chance mode where voters of parties below the threshold receive a second chance to vote for another party, and we establish computational complexity results also in this setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8bae\u4f1a\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9009\u6c11\u6295\u7968\u53d8\u52a8\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5373\u589e\u52a0\u6216\u9650\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u515a\u6d3e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7ade\u9009\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bae\u4f1a\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e2d\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982D'Hondt\u6216Sainte-Lagu\u00eb\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u9009\u4e3e\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u591a\u9009\u533a\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u9009\u6c11\u6295\u7968\u53d8\u52a8\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u9009\u4e3e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7ade\u9009\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7ade\u9009\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9009\u4e3e\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u9009\u533a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7ade\u9009\u5728\u8bae\u4f1a\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a\u9009\u4e3e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5RustyEx\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406Rust\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Rust\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4eceRust\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90Rust\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRustyEx\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To model social interactions, the Graphical House Allocation framework introduces a social graph $G$, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, and an edge $(u, v)$ corresponds to the potential of agent $u$ to envy the agent $v$, based on their allocations and valuations. In undirected social graphs, the potential for envy is in both the directions. In the Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation (ME-GHA) problem, given a set of $n$ agents, $n$ houses, a social graph, and agent's valuation functions, the goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total envy summed up over all the edges of $G$. Recent work, [Hosseini et al., AAMAS 2023, AAMAS 2024] studied ME-GHA in the regime of polynomial-time algorithms, and designed exact and approximation algorithms, for certain graph classes under identical agent valuations. We initiate the study of \\gha with non-identical valuations, a setting that has so far remained unexplored. We investigate the multivariate (parameterized) complexity of \\gha by identifying structural restrictions on the social graph and valuation functions that yield tractability. We also design moderately exponential-time algorithms for several graph classes, and a polynomial-time algorithm for {binary valuations that returns an allocation with envy at most one when the social graph has maximum degree at most one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5ac9\u5992\u56fe\u5f62\u623f\u5c4b\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff08ME-GHA\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u56fe\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684ME-GHA\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u4e0b\u7684ME-GHA\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4f1a\u56fe\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86ME-GHA\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5927\u5ea6\u4e3a1\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u56fe\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u4f30\u503c\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u56fe\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0cME-GHA\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u8fd4\u56de\u5ac9\u5992\u6700\u591a\u4e3a1\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u4e0b\u7684ME-GHA\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
