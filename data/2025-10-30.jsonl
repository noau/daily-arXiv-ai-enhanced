In this\npaper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that\nleverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across\nneighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a\nprincipled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We\ndemonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened\nPoisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements\nover existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and\nboundary value caching.

Unlike prior works focused on\nphotorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and\nview-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium\nwell-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is\nvery challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)\nsketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to\nmodel with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and\n(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view\nconsistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose\n4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches\nfrom text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a\ndual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent\ngeometry using differentiable B\\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion\ndynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),\nwhich optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization\nensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse\nsketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that\nseparates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,\nenabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated\nmovement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally\nrealistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing\nbaselines in both fidelity and controllability.

We conducted structured polls with human participants to\ntest whether real people's preferences conform to commonly assumed utility\nfunctions such as $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Leontief. Our results suggest that\nthese models may have limited explanatory power for actual behavior: most\nparticipants showed inconsistent patterns across different metric comparisons,\nand standard assumptions of project symmetry and sign symmetry -- core features\nof common distance-based metrics -- received little empirical support. However,\nwe find encouraging evidence for more fundamental preference structures: a\nlarge majority of participants showed consistency with star-shaped preferences,\nas well as with peak-linear utility functions, where utility changes\nproportionally with distance from the ideal budget. These findings have\nimportant implications for designers of budget aggregation mechanisms.

In addition, we extend Mitsuba 3's functionality to support\ntime-resolved polarization tracking of light and transient differentiable\nrendering. Finally, we also include tools that simplify the use of our\nsimulations for non-line-of-sight imaging, enabling realistic scene setups with\ncapture noise to be simulated in just seconds of minutes.

Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic", "comment": null, "summary": "Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are\nperfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that\nneither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of\narbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce\ngrounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation\nfor formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive\ndefinitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that\nexpress nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e.,\n\"bottom\") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive\nfunctions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by \"dynamically typing\"\nterms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they\ndenote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven\nterminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar\nclassical rules.

A\nless-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided\nresponse. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control\nto the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more\nsequential moves before the turn resolves.

However, blockchain applications incentivize\nvalidators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals,\nsince increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it\nmay appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible\nin blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in\nresponsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where\ncooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but\nindividual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To\nattain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease\nwith round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured\nthrough a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's\nround time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism\nallows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium,\nbenefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness\nbeing an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness\nitself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a\nstatic to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more\nsensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected\nvalidators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both\ntheoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks."}
