Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ContraGS是一种直接在压缩的3D高斯分布表示上训练的方法，显著减少内存消耗并加速训练和渲染，同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯分布技术（3DGS）需要大量内存和强大GPU进行高质量建模，ContraGS旨在通过压缩表示解决这一问题。

Method: ContraGS利用码表紧凑存储高斯参数向量，并通过贝叶斯推理和MCMC采样解决不可微参数学习问题。

Result: ContraGS平均减少3.49倍训练峰值内存，并分别加速训练和渲染1.36倍和1.88倍，同时保持接近最高质量的模型。

Conclusion: ContraGS提供了一种高效、低内存消耗的3DGS训练方法，显著提升了训练和渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于学习的TensoIS框架，利用分形柏林噪声模拟真实世界中的异构散射参数，并通过低秩张量表示散射体积来进行逆向散射估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法大多假设介质均匀或通过复杂的路径积分和可分体积渲染技术建模BSSRDF，但缺乏对真实世界中异构散射参数的明确分布建模方法。因此，论文探索用分形柏林噪声模拟这种复杂异构性。

Method: 论文首先创建了名为HeteroSynth的合成数据集，其散射参数使用分形柏林噪声建模；随后提出了TensoIS框架，利用可学习的低秩张量分量表示散射体积，从稀疏多视角图像中估计这些异构散射参数。

Conclusion: 该研究探索了分形柏林噪声分布作为潜在建模真实世界异构散射参数的方案，并通过TensoIS框架展示了其在逆向散射任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

### [6] [Hyper Diffusion Avatars: Dynamic Human Avatar Generation using Network Weight Space Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04145)
*Dongliang Cao,Guoxing Sun,Marc Habermann,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.GR

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了人物特定渲染和扩散模型优势，实现了高质量且动态的人体虚拟形象生成。

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于Cosserat杆模型的弹性杆大规模并行实现，包括其不可延展变体，并通过GPU优化技术显著提升了模拟速度，实现了高精度的实时物理模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弹性杆（如线、绳、手术器械）的大变形模拟在计算机模拟中具有重要意义，但传统方法的计算效率较低，难以满足实时交互需求。

Method: 作者采用Cosserat杆模型，提出了其原始CoRdE模型和不可延展变体的GPU并行实现，利用CUDA可扩展编程模型和块间同步技术，实现了多个物理时间步的高效模拟。

Result: 优化后的GPU实现比CPU版本快40倍（原始CoRdE）和15.11倍（不可延展CoRdE），成功模拟了心血管应用中导管/导丝对的实时交互（0.5-1kHz）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过GPU并行化和优化技术，Cosserat杆模型能够高效模拟弹性杆的大变形，为实时物理模拟提供了可行方案。

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

### [8] [When Lifetimes Liberate: A Type System for Arenas with Higher-Order Reachability Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04253)
*Siyuan He,Songlin Jia,Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合区域系统和所有权类型优点的方法，通过可访问性类型实现资源共享和静态生命周期控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶函数语言中静态资源管理的挑战在于控制、表达性和灵活性之间的平衡。现有方法如区域系统和所有权类型各有局限，无法兼顾资源共享和生命周期控制。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的可访问性类型扩展方法，包括A<:和{A}<:两种演算，分别支持粗粒度资源共享和词汇作用域生命周期控制。

Result: 新方法成功地在高阶语言中实现了资源共享和静态生命周期控制，避免了流敏感推理的复杂性，同时保持了表达性和简单性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高阶函数语言的资源管理提供了灵活且安全的解决方案，结合了区域系统和所有权类型的优势。

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，信任启发式对代理人具有个体适应性益处，并为信任如何促进不同类型社会互动中的合作提供了形式化理论。此外，结果对人工智能代理与人类互动具有启示意义。

Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic
models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This
makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different
social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive
shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's
actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We
consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and
systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric
social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another
agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,
then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such
as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust
increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in
cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs
even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.
Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of
using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote
cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the
implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial
intelligence agents.
