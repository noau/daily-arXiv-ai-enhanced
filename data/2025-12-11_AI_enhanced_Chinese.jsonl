Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c063D\u5f62\u72b6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u57fa\u5143\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SuperFrustum\u57fa\u5143\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b33D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SuperFrustum\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u517c\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u6027\uff09\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u8fdb\u884c\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\uff0cIoU\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc79\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c63D\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u672a\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u7b49\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8c08\u5224\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528NegotiationArena\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u591a\u8f6e\u8c08\u5224\u6e38\u620f\uff08\u4e70\u5bb6\u5356\u5bb6\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u6700\u540e\u901a\u7252\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u672a\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5206\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u521d\u59cb\u62a5\u4ef7\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u534f\u8bae\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \\emph{frugality ratio}.\n  We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally provide a family of ``error-tolerant'' auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e0\u5bb9\u91cf\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91c7\u8d2d\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u62cd\u5356\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ed8\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u8005\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86VCG\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u62cd\u5356\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6218\u7565\u6027\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8005\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86VCG\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eVCG\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u8282\u7701\u6bd4\u7387\u4e3a3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u62cd\u5356\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u65f6\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u3002"}}

It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed.\n  We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08FRP\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08FRP\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684FRP\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u2018\u53ef\u53d8\u5f15\u7528\u2019\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684FRP\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u2018later\u2019\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u2018\u53ef\u53d8\u5f15\u7528\u2019\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u591a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u7136\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65b0FRP\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aFRP\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}
