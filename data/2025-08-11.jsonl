The reward in each round is the sum of\n$K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a\nprobability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that\ntask/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is\nof order $K\\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound.\nImproved bounds of order $K (\\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping\nbudget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or\nwinning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions."}

Collaborative\nblock mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to\nform coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data\ntogether to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted\ncollaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both\ntechnologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for\nblockchain systems. While existing research in this area has mainly focused on\nthe single-coalition collaboration mode, where each miner can only join one\ncoalition, this work explores a more comprehensive multi-coalition\ncollaboration mode, which allows each miner to join multiple coalitions. To\nanalyze the behavior of miners and the edge computing service provider (ECP) in\nthis scenario, we propose a novel two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the\nECP, as the leader, determines the prices of computing resources for all MUs.\nIn Stage II, each MU decides the coalitions to join, resulting in an\noverlapping coalition formation (OCF) game; Subsequently, each coalition\ndecides how many edge computing resources to purchase from the ECP, leading to\nan edge resource competition (ERC) game. We derive the closed-form Nash\nequilibrium for the ERC game, based on which we further propose an OCF-based\nalternating algorithm to achieve a stable coalition structure for the OCF game\nand develop a near-optimal pricing strategy for the ECP's resource pricing\nproblem."}

Balancing\nsupply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due\nto capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned\nbatteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation\npotential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the\ndecision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice\nby each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an\nanalysis from a game-theoretic point of view.\n  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic\nsetting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries\nto increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market\nmodel where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize\nrenewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we\nstudy the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing\nstrategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the\nchosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls\nfor more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich\nfield for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable\nenergy networks."}

Control envelopes, which are families of safe control\nsolutions, correspond to nondeterministic winning policies of hybrid games,\nwhere each deterministic specialization of the policy is a control solution.\nThis paper synthesizes nondeterministic winning policies for hybrid games that\nare as permissive as possible. It introduces subvalue maps, a compositional\nrepresentation of such policies that enables verification and synthesis along\nthe structure of the game. An inductive logical characterization in\ndifferential game logic (dGL) checks whether a subvalue map induces a sound\ncontrol envelope which always induces a winning play. A policy is said to win\nif it always achieves the desirable outcome when the player follows it, no\nmatter what actions the opponent plays. The maximal subvalue map, which allows\nthe most action options while still winning, is shown to exist and satisfy a\nlogical characterization. A family of algorithms for nondeterministic policy\nsynthesis can be obtained from the inductive subvalue map soundness\ncharacterization. An implementation of these findings is evaluated on examples\nthat use the expressivity of dGL to model a range of diverse control\nchallenges."}

Code will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is\nchallenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor\ngeneralization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering\ncontrollable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample\ndiversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically\nrequiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided\nFine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion\ntransfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the\ntraining loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the\nfine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation\nthat during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger\nmarginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable\nfidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength\nvalue as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning\nmechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the\nguidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,\ni.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training\nstability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target\ndomains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer\nlearning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling\nTFLOPS."}

In particular, grass-based\ndisplays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To\ndevelop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change\ncharacteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional\nmethods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or\nviewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has\nbegun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues\nas it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an\ninteractive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on\nreal-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's\naccuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints\nand environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results\nindicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics\nsimilar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more\nquickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study."}
