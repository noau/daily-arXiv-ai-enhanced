Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus\non low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability\nand offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation\npipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for\ncompiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second\nquantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum\nparticle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety\nand correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and\nenforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both\ndigital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics,\nfrom static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue,\nincluding its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are\nfully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end\nverified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation."}

This research explored\nzero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have\nnever seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied\nself-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative\nmodel fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the\never-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention\nstrategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes\nbefore they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating\ndeepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity\nverification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and\nblockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,\nzero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as\nadversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence\nof standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by\ndiscussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,\nmultimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for\nenhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake\ndetection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense\nframework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in\ncombination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the\nimportant role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,\ncybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against\nthe rising tide of deepfake attacks."}

We analyze marginal and\nmultiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which\neach deters Sybil strategies.

However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective\nproperties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric\nambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address\nthese limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been\nprohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner\nloop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that\nmake the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less\naccurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build\nan efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the\nclassic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space\nof spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend\nthe classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,\npropose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the\nbackward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than\nauto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering\nwhere light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling\nhundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent\nreflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry\nreconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering\nbaselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known\nor unknown lighting conditions."}

However, these methods not only require intensive\ntraining time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also\nneed to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their\nscalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text\nSlider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies\nlow-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous\ncontrol of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU\nmemory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text\nSlider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling\nfine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis.

Beyond artistic style\ntransfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is\nbecoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized\nby intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,\nwhich poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore\nthe customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content\nfeatures with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of\nimage analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and\nthen adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of\npretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we\npropose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture\nfine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the\nwhole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from\ncontent. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to\nfurther decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.\nFinally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with\nonly the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,\nwe build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior\nmethods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three\nadditional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and\nappearance transfer."}

Approximation algorithms on the other hand have received little\nattention in electoral control, despite their prevalence in the study of other\nforms of electoral attacks, such as manipulation and bribery. Early work\nestablished some preliminary results with respect to popular voting rules such\nas plurality, approval, and Condorcet. In this paper, we establish for each of\nthe ``standard'' control problems under plurality, approval, and Condorcet,\nwhether they are approximable, and we prove our results in both the weighted\nand unweighted voter settings. For each problem we study under either approval\nor Condorcet, we show that any approximation algorithm we give is optimal,\nunless P=NP. Our approximation algorithms leverage the fact that Covering\nInteger Programs (CIPs) can be approximated within a factor of $O(\\log n)$.\nUnder plurality, we give an $O(m)$-approximation algorithm, and give as lower\nbound $\\Omega(m^{1/4})$, by using a known lower bound on the Minimum $k$-Union\n(M$k$U) problem.
