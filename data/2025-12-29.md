*Yosuke Onoue*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文挑战了基于应力图形绘制中使用图论最短距离的惯例，提出了基于拉普拉斯矩阵谱的电阻距离新范式，能更好地捕捉全局图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在理论和计算上存在局限性，特别是在捕捉全局图结构和实现高效算法方面。因此，本文提出了一种基于电阻距离的新方法，以克服这些限制。

Method: 提出了Omega算法，通过快速计算电阻距离嵌入并结合随机节点对采样的随机梯度下降（SGD），实现了线性时间复杂度的高低应力值稳定绘制。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在邻域保持和簇一致性方面表现更优，且算法的复杂度保持在$O(|E|)$，适用于加权和非加权图。

Conclusion: 本文建立了谱图理论与基于应力布局的联系，为网络可视化提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper challenges the convention of using graph-theoretic shortest distance in stress-based graph drawing. We propose a new paradigm based on resistance distance, derived from the graph Laplacian's spectrum, which better captures global graph structure. This approach overcomes theoretical and computational limitations of traditional methods, as resistance distance admits a natural isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Our experiments demonstrate improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. We introduce Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that integrates a fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This comprehensive random sampling strategy, enabled by efficient pre-computation of resistance distance embeddings, is more effective and robust than pivot-based sampling used in prior algorithms, consistently achieving lower and more stable stress values. The algorithm maintains $O(|E|)$ complexity for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our work establishes a connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing a practical and scalable solution for network visualization.

### [2] [Quantitative Verification of Omega-regular Properties in Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21596)
*Peixin Wang,Jianhao Bai,Min Zhang,C. -H. Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TPI的新框架，将概率编程与时序逻辑统一，通过计算满足omega正则规范的执行轨迹的后验分布来解决传统方法无法捕捉概率行为时序演化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率编程推理技术通常只能在固定时间点（如程序终止时）计算后验分布，无法捕捉概率行为的时序演化。这限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 作者提出了TPI框架，结合概率编程与时序逻辑，通过计算满足omega正则规范的执行轨迹的后验分布。此外，开发了一种新方法来计算omega正则属性满足概率的上下界。

Result: 论文通过原型工具TPInfer在多个基准测试上验证了方法的有效性和高效性，展示了其在处理复杂时序属性的概率模型中的优势。

Conclusion: TPI框架为解决概率编程中时序行为的推理问题提供了一种有效方法，并通过严格的数学保证和实际验证证明了其可行性。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.

### [3] [Dynamic Cooperative Strategies in Search Engine Advertising Market: With and Without Retail Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21501)
*Huiran Li,Qiucheng Li,Baozhu Feng*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本研究通过建模两种合作广告决策情景，为搜索引擎广告（SEA）市场中的合作广告提供管理指南，并为参与者提供关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在竞争激烈的搜索引擎广告市场中，零售商和制造商之间的渠道协调对广告策略效果至关重要。

Method: 研究提出了一种新颖的合作广告优化模型，涵盖直接和间接广告方式，并结合动态质量分数和有限时间范围。

Result: 为两种情景提供了可行的均衡解决方案，并通过数值实验分析了质量分数、毛利率和初始市场份额的影响。

Conclusion: 零售竞争对合作联盟的最优策略和渠道绩效有显著影响，研究结果为SEA市场中的合作广告参与者提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In search engine advertising (SEA) market, where competition among retailers is intense and multifaceted, channel coordination between retailers and manufacturers emerges as a critical factor, which significantly influences the effectiveness of advertising strategies. This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market.

Main category: cs.GT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不可分割物品在代理人之间的公平分配问题，重点是限制嫉妒的存在。

Method: 在多图中不包含长度为三的环的假设下，证明了EFX分配的存在性，并提出了一种伪多项式时间算法来计算此类分配。

Result: 在多图中不含长度为三的环时，EFX分配总是存在，且在单调估值下，提供了高效的算法支持。

Conclusion: 该研究进一步扩展了EFX分配的存在性范围，尤其是在多图环境下，为公平分配问题提供了新的理论基础和算法支持。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents, with a focus on limiting envy. A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for graphical valuations, where goods correspond to edges in a graph, agents to nodes, and each agent values only incident edges. The graph was required to be simple, i.e., for any pair of agents, there could be at most one good that both agents value. The problem remained open, however, for multi-graph valuations, where for a pair of agents several goods may have value to both. In this setting, Sgouritsa and Sotiriou [2025] established existence whenever the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least six, while Afshinmehr et al. [2025] proved existence when the graph contains no odd cycles. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that EFX allocations always exist in multi-graphs that contain no cycle of length three. Assuming monotone valuations, we further provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for computing such an allocation, which runs in polynomial time when agents have cancelable valuations, a strict superclass of additive valuation functions. Accordingly, our results stand as one of the only cases where EFX allocations exist for an arbitrary number of agents.

### [5] [Near-Optimal Coalition Structures in Polynomial Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21657)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了联盟结构生成问题，比较了三种算法范式的实时性能：动态规划、MILP分支定界和基于贪心或$l_1$方法的稀疏松弛。结果表明，稀疏松弛能在多项式时间内以高概率恢复接近最优的联盟结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于比较不同算法范式在处理联盟结构生成问题时的实时性能差异，尤其是稀疏松弛方法的有效性。

Method: 研究方法包括动态规划、MILP分支定界和稀疏松弛方法，并在随机“稀疏协同”模型下进行分析。

Result: 研究结果表明，稀疏松弛方法能以高概率在多项式时间内恢复接近最优的联盟结构，而动态规划和MILP算法则需指数时间才能达到类似解质量。

Conclusion: 结论表明稀疏松弛方法在实时性能上具有显著优势，尽管精确方法最终能达到最优解。

Abstract: We study the classical coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and compare the anytime behavior of three algorithmic paradigms: dynamic programming (DP), MILP branch-and-bound, and sparse relaxations based on greedy or $l_1$-type methods. Under a simple random "sparse synergy" model for coalition values, we prove that sparse relaxations recover coalition structures whose welfare is arbitrarily close to optimal in polynomial time with high probability. In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal.

*Qiushi Han,David Simchi-Levi,Renfei Tan,Zishuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.GT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决在多代理场景中，如何在不了解代理先验信念的情况下，设计一个既能保证真实报告又能实现成本最优的机制。

Method: 方法是通过分布鲁棒自适应机制（DRAM），结合在线学习和机制设计，迭代更新线性规划以缩小模糊集，从而减少支付并保持真实性。

Result: 结果显示，DRAM能以高概率保证真实报告，并实现$	ilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$的累积遗憾，同时证明不存在更优的真实自适应机制。

Conclusion: 结论是DRAM是在未知激励约束下，首个能同时保持真实性和最优遗憾的自适应机制，支持结构化先验和延迟反馈。

Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.

### [7] [Determining Blockchain Transaction Timing and Fee with Observable Mempools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21923)
*Qianlan Bai,Yuedong Xu,Zhijian Zhou,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了公共区块链系统中战略性用户如何优化交易费用和广播时间，以应对采矿间隔的不确定性和费用调整的新功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链交易费用的设置和广播时间的选择对交易处理优先级至关重要。现有研究未充分考虑用户的战略性行为和费用调整的新特性

Method: 论文从单一战略性用户的视角提出了一种交易策略，考虑了两种场景：普通用户随机设置费用和半战略用户周期性检查费用

Result: 研究发现，在比特币类PoW系统中，用户应立即广播交易；而在以太坊类PoS系统中，用户应延迟广播。费用调整策略表明，一旦费用落后，应立即提高

Conclusion: 战略性用户通过优化广播时间和费用调整频率，可以显著提高交易处理优先级，特别是在不同区块链系统中需采用不同策略

Abstract: Transaction fee plays an important role in determining the priority of transaction processing in public blockchain systems. Owing to the observability of unconfirmed transactions, a strategic user can postpone his transaction broadcasting time and set a fee as low as possible by prying into his mempool that stores them. However, the stochastic mining interval may cause the delayed transaction to miss the next valid block. Meanwhile, a new feature (i.e. fee bumping) emerges that allows each user to increase his transaction fee before confirmation, making the fee setting more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a novel transaction policy from the perspective of a single strategic user that determines the broadcasting time and the transaction fee simultaneously. Two representative scenarios are considered, in which a number of coexisting ordinary users are mempool-oblivious that set their fees according to certain distribution, and are semi-strategic that check their mempools at a Poisson rate and update their fees. In the former, we compute the optimal broadcasting time and transaction fee that adapts to the arbitrary distribution of mining interval. When the block interval is exponentially distributed in Bitcoin-like PoW systems, the strategic user needs to broadcast his transaction immediately after its creation. And when the block interval is fixed in Ethereum-like PoS systems, he finds it profitable to wait until the last moment before block generation. In the latter, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of mempool states, and derive the optimal fee adjusting frequency of the strategic user when the block interval is exponentially distributed. In both theory and simulations, we show that this strategic user should immediately increase his fee whenever it falls behind the minimum fee of being included.

### [8] [Deep Learning Based Auction Design for Selling Agricultural Produce through Farmer Collectives to Maximize Nash Social Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22039)
*Mayank Ratan Bhardwaj,Vishisht Srihari Rao,Bazil Ahmed,Kartik Sagar,Y. Narahari*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VDA-SAP的拍卖机制，旨在通过农民集体作为销售代理和高消费量或零售消费者作为购买代理，设计一个既激励兼容又个体合理的市场机制，最大化纳什社会福利并满足实际业务约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种稳健的市场机制，以同时惠及农民（农产品生产者）和农产品买家（消费者）。

Method: 提出了一种基于农民集体的折扣拍卖机制（VDA-SAP），并通过深度学习网络学习如何在最小化违反期望属性的情况下实现理想的拍卖机制。

Result: VDA-SAP机制在满足多种理想属性方面优于经典的VCG机制，并在其他基准拍卖中表现更优。

Conclusion: VDA-SAP机制不仅在理论上满足激励兼容和个体合理性，还能在实际业务中表现出色，特别适用于农产品销售场景。

Abstract: This paper is motivated by the need to design a robust market mechanism to benefit farmers (producers of agricultural produce) as well as buyers of agricultural produce (consumers). Our proposal is a volume discount auction with a Farmer Collective (FC) as the selling agent and high volume or retail consumers as buying agents. An FC is a cooperative of farmers coming together to harness the power of aggregation and economies of scale. Our auction mechanism seeks to satisfy fundamental properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality, and an extremely relevant property for the agriculture setting, namely, Nash social welfare maximization. Besides satisfying these properties, our proposed auction mechanism also ensures that certain practical business constraints are met. Since an auction satisfying all of these properties exactly is a theoretical impossibility, we invoke the idea of designing deep learning networks that learn such an auction with minimal violation of the desired properties. The proposed auction, which we call VDA-SAP (Volume Discount Auction for Selling Agricultural Produce), is superior in many ways to the classical VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism in terms of richness of properties satisfied and further outperforms other baseline auctions as well. We demonstrate our results for a realistic setting of an FC selling perishable vegetables to potential buyers.
