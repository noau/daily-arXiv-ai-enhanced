*Stephen Mell,Favyen Bastani,Steve Zdancewic,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Quivr是一个创新框架，能够通过示例合成轨迹查询，解决了数据科学家在处理模糊真实数据时需要手动调整参数的挑战。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据的模糊性，数据科学家在处理机器学习模型的预测（如视频数据中的物体检测和轨迹）时需要手动调整参数编写查询，这一过程复杂且耗时。

Method: Quivr引入了新的参数空间修剪技术和定量语义学，以高效合成匹配示例的轨迹查询。

Result: Quivr在17个任务（包括此前工作中的多个任务）上进行了评估，证明了其能够为每个任务合成准确的查询，并显著降低了合成时间。

Conclusion: Quivr框架通过创新的参数合成技术和优化方法，成功提升了轨迹查询的效率和准确性，解决了数据科学中的实际挑战。

Abstract: Data scientists often need to write programs to process predictions of machine learning models, such as object detections and trajectories in video data. However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.

### [2] [Autodeleveraging as Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15182)
*Tarun Chitra,Nagu Thogiti,Mauricio Jean Pieer Trujillo Ramirez,Victor Xu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了自动去杠杆（ADL）作为一种在线学习问题，旨在为永续期货市场提供解决偿付能力不足的机制，并通过理论和实证分析优化其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 永续期货市场中，当清算和保险缓冲不足以恢复偿付能力时，ADL机制被用作最后手段。然而，ADL作为一种顺序控制问题，缺乏正式的理论研究。

Method: 论文将ADL形式化为在线学习问题，在每个回合中选择偿付预算和盈利交易账户，通过清算这些账户来恢复交易所的整体偿付能力。

Result: 理论分析提供了ADL机制的鲁棒性和性能上限，并通过2025年Hyperliquid压力事件验证了优化算法的有效性，显著减少了超额清算。

Conclusion: 论文提供了简单且可实施的ADL优化机制，显著提升了永续期货交易所的偿付能力恢复效率。

Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism used by perpetual futures venues when liquidation and insurance buffers are insufficient to restore solvency. Despite the scale of perpetual futures markets, ADL has received limited formal treatment as a sequential control problem. This paper provides a concise formalization of ADL as online learning on a PNL-haircut domain: at each round, the venue selects a solvency budget and a set of profitable trader accounts. The profitable accounts are liquidated to cover shortfalls up to the solvency budget, with the aim of recovering exchange-wide solvency. In this model, ADL haircuts apply to positive PNL (unrealized gains), not to posted collateral principal. Using our online learning model, we provide robustness results and theoretical upper bounds on how poorly a mechanism can perform at recovering solvency. We apply our model to the October 10, 2025 Hyperliquid stress episode. The regret caused by Hyperliquid's production ADL queue is about 50\% of an upper bound on regret, calibrated to this event, while our optimized algorithm achieves about 2.6\% of the same bound. In dollar terms, the production ADL model over liquidates trader profits by up to \$51.7M. We also counterfactually evaluated algorithms inspired by our online learning framework that perform better and found that the best algorithm reduces overshoot to \$3M. Our results provide simple, implementable mechanisms for improving ADL in live perpetuals exchanges.

### [3] [Interbank Lending Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15186)
*Jinyun Tong,Bart de Keijzer,Haoxiang Wang,Carmine Ventre*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文定义并研究了一种借贷博弈模型，用于描述银行间货币市场中借贷银行的策略性现金分配行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究银行间货币市场中借贷银行的策略行为，特别是在中央银行的利率走廊设定下，借贷银行如何最大化利息收入。

Method: 通过定义和分析一个无限策略的潜在博弈，证明其存在唯一的纯策略纳什均衡，并提出一个强多项式时间算法来计算该均衡。

Result: 证明了博弈存在唯一的纯策略纳什均衡，并且某些最优响应动态在离散和连续时间场景下都会收敛到该均衡。

Conclusion: 该借贷博弈模型为银行间市场的策略分析提供了理论基础，并通过算法实现了均衡的计算。

Abstract: We define and study a lending game to model the interbank money market, in which lending banks strategically allocate their cash to borrowing banks. The interest rate offered by each borrowing bank is within the interest rate corridor set by the central bank and ultimately depends on the demand and the supply of cash in the interbank market. Lending banks naturally aim to maximise the income coming from the interest repayments. In its purest form, this is an infinite-strategy game that we show to be an exact potential game which has a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We then define and solve a constrained optimisation problem and propose a strongly polynomial-time algorithm to compute this Nash equilibrium. We also study some variants of best-response dynamics of this lending game, showing that they converge to the Nash equilibrium in both discrete and continuous-time scenarios.

### [4] [Equilibria in Large Position-Optimization Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15225)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一类称为位置优化游戏的对称游戏，研究了玩家在空间中选择位置以最大化效用的均衡问题，证明了在玩家数量足够大时存在纯策略和对称混合纳什均衡，并分析了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究玩家在选择位置时的均衡行为，扩展了Hotelling游戏和预测竞赛等应用模型，填补了相关领域的研究空白。

Method: 引入位置优化游戏模型，定义玩家的效用函数为目标Q-质量与位置距离的关系，证明了在大玩家数量下纯策略和对称混合纳什均衡的存在性及其收敛性。

Result: 证明了玩家选择有限伪目标集合的极端均衡存在，且均衡策略收敛于由Q分布导出的P分布，并给出了收敛速率的界限。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅扩展了Hotelling游戏的研究成果，还为预测竞赛等新应用提供了理论基础，展示了均衡策略的收敛性质。

Abstract: We propose a general class of symmetric games called position-optimization games. Given a probability distribution $Q$ over a set of targets $\mathcal{Y}$, the $n$ players each choose a position in a space $\mathcal{X}$. A player's utility is the $Q$-mass of targets they are closest to under some proximity measure, with ties broken evenly. Our model captures Hotelling games and forecasting competitions, among other applications. We show that for sufficiently large $n$, both pure and symmetric mixed Nash equilibria exist, and moreover are extreme: all players play on a finite set of pseudo-targets $\mathcal{X}^* \subseteq \mathcal{X}$. We further show that both pure and symmetric mixed equilibria converge to the distribution $P$ on $\mathcal{X}^*$ induced by $Q$, and bound the convergence rate in $n$. The generality of our model allows us to extend and strengthen previous work in Hotelling games, and prove entirely new results in forecasting competitions and other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决不完全信息扩展形式游戏中完美贝叶斯均衡的计算问题，并通过改进现有的算法提升均衡质量和运行效率。

Method: 方法采用了基于Bonanno定义的PBE，结合信念修订理论，通过改进的反事实遗憾最小化（CFR）算法来计算PBE。

Result: 实验结果证明，PBE-CFR算法在两玩家零和游戏中表现正确，且在非零和的大型游戏中展现了出色的均衡质量和运行时间。

Conclusion: 结论指出，PBE作为元策略求解器在复杂不完全信息结构的EFG模型中表现优于未精炼的纳什均衡方法。

Abstract: Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium for imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs) that enforces consistency between the two components of a solution: agents' strategy profile describing their decisions at information sets and the belief system quantifying their uncertainty over histories within an information set. We present a scalable approach for computing a PBE of an arbitrary two-player EFG. We adopt the definition of PBE enunciated by Bonanno in 2011 using a consistency concept based on the theory of belief revision due to Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson. Our algorithm for finding a PBE is an adaptation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that minimizes the expected regret at each information set given a belief system, while maintaining the necessary consistency criteria. We prove that our algorithm is correct for two-player zero-sum games and has a reasonable slowdown in time-complexity relative to classical CFR given the additional computation needed for refinement. We also experimentally demonstrate the competent performance of PBE-CFR in terms of equilibrium quality and running time on medium-to-large non-zero-sum EFGs. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of using PBE for strategy exploration in empirical game-theoretic analysis. Specifically, we compute PBE as a meta-strategy solver (MSS) in a tree-exploiting variant of Policy Space Response Oracles (TE-PSRO). Our experiments show that PBE as an MSS leads to higher-quality empirical EFG models with complex imperfect information structures compared to MSSs based on an unrefined Nash equilibrium.

Abstract: In game theory, imperfect-recall decision problems model situations in which an agent forgets information it held before. They encompass games such as the ``absentminded driver'' and team games with limited communication. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark suite for imperfect-recall decision problems. Our benchmarks capture a variety of problem types, including ones concerning privacy in AI systems that elicit sensitive information, and AI safety via testing of agents in simulation. Across 61 problem instances generated using this suite, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms for finding first-order optimal strategies in such problems. In particular, we introduce the family of regret matching (RM) algorithms for nonlinear constrained optimization. This class of parameter-free algorithms has enjoyed tremendous success in solving large two-player zero-sum games, but, surprisingly, they were hitherto relatively unexplored beyond that setting. Our key finding is that RM algorithms consistently outperform commonly employed first-order optimizers such as projected gradient descent, often by orders of magnitude. This establishes, for the first time, the RM family as a formidable approach to large-scale constrained optimization problems.

### [7] [Simultaneous Ordinal Maximin Share and Envy-Based Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15566)
*Hannaneh Akrami,Timo Reichert*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在不可分割物品的公平分配中，如何同时满足基于序数近似的MMS和基于嫉妒的公平性概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于现有文献中关于公平分配的两类主要概念（嫉妒基和份额基）的研究，尤其是MMS及其近似与EF1或EFX等嫉妒基公平性的兼容性。

Method: 研究方法是首次探索MMS的序数近似与基于嫉妒的公平性概念的兼容性，并通过具体实例证明了某些联合保障的存在性。

Result: 研究结果表明存在满足以下联合保障的分配：(i) 有序实例中同时满足1-out-of-⌈3n/2⌉ MMS和EFX；(ii) top-n实例中同时满足1-out-of-⌈3n/2⌉ MMS和EF1；(iii) 有序实例中同时满足1-out-of-4⌈n/3⌉ MMS和EF1。

Conclusion: 结论表明了在特定实例中，MMS的序数近似与嫉妒基公平性概念可以同时实现，为公平分配问题提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations. The fair division literature has traditionally focused on two broad classes of fairness notions: envy-based notions and share-based notions. Within the share-based framework, most attention has been devoted to the maximin share (MMS) guarantee and its relaxations, while envy-based fairness has primarily centered on EFX and its relaxations. Recent work has shown the existence of allocations that simultaneously satisfy multiplicative approximate MMS and envy-based guarantees such as EF1 or EFX.
  Motivated by this line of research, we study for the first time the compatibility between ordinal approximations of MMS and envy-based fairness notions. In particular, we establish the existence of allocations satisfying the following combined guarantees: (i) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\lceil 3n/2 \rceil$ MMS and EFX for ordered instances; (ii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\lceil 3n/2 \rceil$ MMS and EF1 for top-$n$ instances; and (iii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$4\lceil n/3 \rceil$ MMS and EF1 for ordered instances.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of network allocation games called graphical distance preservation games. Here, we are given a graph, called a topology, and a set of agents that need to be allocated to its vertices. Moreover, every agent has an ideal (and possibly different) distance in which to be from some of the other agents. Given an allocation of agents, each one of them suffers a cost that is the sum of the differences from the ideal distance for each agent in their subset. The goal is to decide whether there is a stable allocation of the agents, i.e., no agent would like to deviate from their location. Specifically, we consider three different stability notions: envy-freeness, swap stability, and jump stability. We perform a comprehensive study of the (parameterized) complexity of the problem in three different dimensions: the topology of the graph, the number of agents, and the structure of preferences of the agents.
