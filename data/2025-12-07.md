*Jin Zhou,Hongliang Yang,Pengfei Xu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SPLICE是一种新型的3D形状部分级神经隐式表示方法，支持直观、结构感知和高保真的形状编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经隐式表示在3D形状编辑中存在可编辑性有限、缺乏部分级控制以及修改或重新排列形状部分时结果不自然的问题。

Method: SPLICE通过独立编码每个形状部分并使用参数化高斯椭球定位，隔离部分特定特征，同时丢弃可能阻碍灵活操作的全局上下文。采用全局注意力解码器，并通过注意力引导过滤机制防止对称或相邻组件间的信息泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，SPLICE在各种形状编辑任务中定性和定量上均优于现有方法，支持包括平移、旋转、缩放、删除、复制和跨形状部分混合等操作。

Conclusion: SPLICE提供了一种高效的方法，使用户能够灵活探索设计变化，同时保持语义一致性和结构合理性。

Abstract: Neural implicit representations of 3D shapes have shown great potential in 3D shape editing due to their ability to model high-level semantics and continuous geometric representations. However, existing methods often suffer from limited editability, lack of part-level control, and unnatural results when modifying or rearranging shape parts. In this work, we present SPLICE, a novel part-level neural implicit representation of 3D shapes that enables intuitive, structure-aware, and high-fidelity shape editing. By encoding each shape part independently and positioning them using parameterized Gaussian ellipsoids, SPLICE effectively isolates part-specific features while discarding global context that may hinder flexible manipulation. A global attention-based decoder is then employed to integrate parts coherently, further enhanced by an attention-guiding filtering mechanism that prevents information leakage across symmetric or adjacent components. Through this architecture, SPLICE supports various part-level editing operations, including translation, rotation, scaling, deletion, duplication, and cross-shape part mixing. These operations enable users to flexibly explore design variations while preserving semantic consistency and maintaining structural plausibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPLICE outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively across a diverse set of shape-editing tasks.

Abstract: Image convolution with complex kernels is a fundamental operation in photography, scientific imaging, and animation effects, yet direct dense convolution is computationally prohibitive on resource-limited devices. Existing approximations, such as simulated annealing or low-rank decompositions, either lack efficiency or fail to capture non-convex kernels. We introduce a differentiable kernel decomposition framework that represents a target spatially-variant, dense, complex kernel using a set of sparse kernel samples. Our approach features (i) a decomposition that enables differentiable optimization of sparse kernels, (ii) a dedicated initialization strategy for non-convex shapes to avoid poor local minima, and (iii) a kernel-space interpolation scheme that extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining and additional runtime overhead. Experiments on Gaussian and non-convex kernels show that our method achieves higher fidelity than simulated annealing and significantly lower cost than low-rank decompositions. Our approach provides a practical solution for mobile imaging and real-time rendering, while remaining fully differentiable for integration into broader learning pipelines.

### [3] [Typing Fallback Functions: A Semantic Approach to Type Safe Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04755)
*Stian Lybech,Daniele Gorla,Luca Aceto*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文在智能合约环境中开发语义类型，以确保使用静态不可类型化语言构造（如fallback函数）的代码的类型安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约中静态不可类型化的语言构造可能导致类型安全问题，因此需要通过形式化证明确保代码的类型安全。

Method: 论文提出一种方法，合约创建者为包含不可类型化构造的代码提供类型安全的形式化证明，用户只需验证提供的“证明证书”。此外，论文以TINYSOL语言为例，通过安全类型确保信息流控制和非干扰性。

Result: 论文展示了类型语义的定义、安全证明的表达方式，以及如何在区块链环境中应用这些理论工具。

Conclusion: 主要贡献是为区块链/智能合约环境提供必要的理论发展，确保不可类型化构造的安全性，而不仅仅是安全定理本身。

Abstract: This paper develops semantic typing in a smart-contract setting to ensure type safety of code that uses statically untypable language constructs, such as the fallback function. The idea is that the creator of a contract on the blockchain equips code containing such constructs with a formal proof of its type safety, given in terms of the semantics of types. Then, a user of the contract only needs to check the validity of the provided `proof certificate' of type safety. This is a form of proof-carrying code, which naturally fits with the immutable nature of the blockchain environment.
  As a concrete application of our approach, we focus on ensuring information flow control and non-interference for the language TINYSOL, a distilled version of the Solidity language, through security types. We provide the semantics of types in terms of a typed operational semantics of TINYSOL, and a way for expressing the proofs of safety as coinductively-defined typing interpretations and for representing them compactly via up-to techniques, similar to those used for bisimilarity. We also show how our machinery can be used to type the typical pointer-to-implementation pattern based on the fallback function. However, our main contribution is not the safety theorem per se (and so security properties different from non-interference can be considered as well), but rather the presentation of the theoretical developments necessary to make this approach work in a blockchain/smart-contract setting.

Abstract: Join patterns are an underexplored approach for the programming of concurrent and distributed systems. When applied to the actor model, join patterns offer the novel capability of matching combinations of messages in the mailbox of an actor. Previous work by Philipp Haller et al. in the paper "Fair Join Pattern Matching for Actors" (ECOOP 2024) explored join patterns with conditional guards in an actor-based setting with a specification of fair and deterministic matching semantics. Nevertheless, the question of time efficiency in fair join pattern matching has remained underexplored. The stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. performs worse than an implementation that adapts the Rete algorithm to the regular version of a join pattern matching benchmark, while outperforming on a variant with heavy conditional guards, which take longer to evaluate. Nevertheless, conforming Rete to the problem of join pattern matching requires heavy manual adaptation.
  In this thesis, we enhance and optimize the stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. to achieve up to tenfold performance improvements on certain benchmarks, approaching the performance of Rete on regular benchmarks while maintaining the advantages of versatility and performance with heavy guards. We also enhance the benchmark suite, adding new features and enhancing its extensibility and user-friendliness. We extend the join pattern implementation with a less ambiguous syntax as well as dynamic pattern switching. Finally, we present a new complex model use case for join patterns, showing their applicability in a microservice web architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于现有关于RL防御漏洞的研究主要集中在重复标准博弈中，而在随机博弈中的扩展仍未被充分探索，因此填补了这一研究空白。

Conclusion: 结论强调了提出的策略的有效性，以及智能攻击者对RL防御系统的潜在威胁。

Abstract: The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear influence network model. To overcome the structural limitations of prior methods, we propose and apply neuro-dynamic programming. Our experimental results demonstrate that the omniscient attacker can significantly outperform a naive defender, highlighting the critical vulnerability introduced by the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

### [6] [Side-by-side first-price auctions with imperfect bidders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04850)
*Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了显示广告中常见的"并列竞价"采购场景，证明了在标准分布假设下迭代最佳响应算法收敛到均衡点，并提供了唯一性的充分条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨理论上尚未充分研究的两种不完美竞价者代表单一买家同时行动的采购场景，即"并列竞价"，填补理论研究空白。

Method: 采用迭代最佳响应算法，基于标准分布假设，分析算法的收敛性和均衡点的唯一性。

Result: 证明了算法收敛到均衡点，并提供了均衡点唯一性的充分条件，为并列竞价采购的定量研究提供了数值方法。

Conclusion: 论文不仅确立了均衡点的存在性和算法的收敛性，还为并列竞价采购的量化研究提供了实用的数值工具。

Abstract: We model a procurement scenario in which two \textit{imperfect} bidders act simultaneously on behalf of a single buyer, a configuration common in display advertising and referred to as \textit{side-by-side bidding} but largely unexplored in theory. We prove that the iterated best response algorithm converges to an equilibrium under standard distributional assumptions and provide sufficient condition for uniqueness. Beyond establishing existence and convergence, our analysis provides a tractable numerical method for quantitative studies of side-by-side procurement.
