To address these limitations,\nwe propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural\nConstitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial\ndifferential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs\ntwo separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.\nSimultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional\ninputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios\nwith varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across\ndifferent properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.\nFurthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its\nexplicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical\nparameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our\nframework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental\nresults demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,\nrobust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters\nestimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a\nunified simulator and inverse analysis tool."}

This problem is\nrelated to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median\nproblems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each\nagent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we\nconsider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to\nthem. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to\nminimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen\ncommittee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both\nlow-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing\nnotions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings.\nMoreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we\ncall NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While\nall existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this\nintuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously\nlow-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to\nform low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings."}

Shi", "Martin J. Wainwright", "Stephen Bates"], "title": "Instance-Adaptive Hypothesis Tests with Heterogeneous Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic\nagents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the\npopulation yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the\nperformance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how\nit is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal\ntests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their\nprivate information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the\nprincipal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of\nthe agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all\nseparating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an\narbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where\ninformation elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible\nadditional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving\nstatistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper\nscoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test\nconstrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the\ngeometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error\ntrade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with\nmechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation\ncan be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing."}

Classical models of shift bribery assume voters\nact independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in\nreality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a\nsocial network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby\namplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,\nwhere voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs\nrepresent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not\nconfined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the\nnetwork, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and\nindividual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a\ndesignated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists\nwithin budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and\nnetwork-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is\nNP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when\nparameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design\npolynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority\nrules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for\ntransitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform\narc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further\nprove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as\nparameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and\npseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform\narc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for\nshift bribery in social networks."}

Under the\nexchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as\na parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an\ninfinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are\nLipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate\n$\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous\nsetting, we prove the same $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the\nimportant special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in\ndynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel\napproximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive\nDesign (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated\nequilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting\napproximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,\nscalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction\nsettings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over\nfirst-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods."}

Oechtering", "Mikael Skoglund"], "title": "Privacy Guarantee for Nash Equilibrium Computation of Aggregative Games Based on Pointwise Maximal Leakage", "comment": null, "summary": "Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium\n(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely\nemployed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional\nknowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for\ncorrelated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise\nmaximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By\nincorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a\nprecise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In\nthe entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy\nguarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the\nindividual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper\nbound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize\nthat PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to\nadequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct\nexperiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information\nto illustrate the effectiveness of our framework."}
