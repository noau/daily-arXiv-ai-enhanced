If a virtual character's facial expression does not align well with its body movements, it may weaken the perception of the character as a cohesive whole. Motivated by this, we propose B2F, a model that generates facial motions aligned with body movements. B2F takes a facial style reference as input, generating facial animations that reflect the provided style while maintaining consistency with the associated body motion. To achieve this, B2F learns a disentangled representation of content and style, using alignment and consistency-based objectives. We represent style using discrete latent codes learned via the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling diverse expression generation with a structured latent representation. B2F outputs facial motion in the FLAME format, making it compatible with SMPL-X characters, and supports ARKit-style avatars through a dedicated conversion module. Our evaluations show that B2F generates expressive and engaging facial animations that synchronize with body movements and style intent, while mitigating perceptual dissonance from mismatched cues, and generalizing across diverse characters and styles."}

By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible."}
