This method often produces visual artifacts known as floaters--nearly transparent, disconnected elements that drift in space away from the actual surface. This geometric inaccuracy undermines the reliability of these models for practical applications, which is critical. To address this issue, we introduce TIDI-GS, a new training framework designed to eliminate these floaters. A key benefit of our approach is that it functions as a lightweight plugin for the standard 3DGS pipeline, requiring no major architectural changes and adding minimal overhead to the training process. The core of our method is a floater pruning algorithm--TIDI--that identifies and removes floaters based on several criteria: their consistency across multiple viewpoints, their spatial relationship to other elements, and an importance score learned during training. The framework includes a mechanism to preserve fine details, ensuring that important high-frequency elements are not mistakenly removed. This targeted cleanup is supported by a monocular depth-based loss function that helps improve the overall geometric structure of the scene. Our experiments demonstrate that TIDI-GS improves both the perceptual quality and geometric integrity of reconstructions, transforming them into robust digital assets, suitable for high-fidelity applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIDI-GS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u96643D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d6e\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f63D\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6d6e\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff08floaters\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "TIDI-GS\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTIDI\u7684\u6d6e\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u4fee\u526a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTIDI-GS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDI-GS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6d6e\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

With respect to AnyPrice Share (APS) fairness, Kulkarni et al. (2024) showed that, when agents have binary marginal values, a $0.1222$-APS allocation can be found in polynomial time, and there exists an instance where no allocation is better than $0.5$-approximate APS. Very recently, Feige and Grinberg (2025) extended the problem to the asymmetric case, where agents may have different entitlements, and improved the approximation ratio to $1/6$ for general XOS valuations. In this work, we focus on the asymmetric setting with binary XOS valuations, and further improve the approximation ratio to $1/2$, which matches the known upper bound. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an allocation. Beyond APS fairness, we also study the weighted maximin share (WMMS) fairness. Farhadi et al. (2019) showed that, a $1/n$-WMMS allocation always exists for agents with general additive valuations, and that this approximation ratio is tight. We extend this result to general XOS valuations, where a $1/n$-WMMS allocation still exists, and this approximation ratio cannot be improved even when marginal values are binary.

In this paper we analyze this situation, and we present a practical study where genetic algorithms are used to assess the benefits of lying under different situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5e73\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u4e0b\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8c0e\u62a5\u504f\u597d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8c0e\u62a5\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e73\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c0e\u62a5\u504f\u597d\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u8c0e\u62a5\u504f\u597d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u8c0e\u62a5\u504f\u597d\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u5176\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Domain-specific languages (DSL) typically use higher level intermediate representations (IR) in their compiler pipelines for domain-specific optimizations. As these IRs add to complexity, it is crucial to test them thoroughly. Random program generators have proven to be an effective tool to test compilers through differential and fuzz testing. However, developing specialized program generators for compiler IRs is not straightforward and demands considerable resources. We introduce MLIR-Forge, a novel random program generator framework that leverages the flexibility of MLIR, aiming to simplify the creation of specialized program generators. MLIR-Forge achieves this by splitting the generation process into fundamental building blocks that are language specific, and reusable program creation logic that constructs random programs from these building blocks. This hides complexity and furthermore, even the language specific components can be defined using a set of common tools. We demonstrate MLIR-Forge's capabilities by generating MLIR with built-in dialects, WebAssembly, and a data-centric program representation, DaCe -- requiring less than a week of development time in total for each of them. Using the generated programs we conduct differential testing and find 9 MLIR, 15 WebAssembly, and 774 DaCe groups of bugs with the corresponding program generators, after running them until the rate of new bugs stagnates.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLIR-Forge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668IR\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08IR\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3002MLIR-Forge\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7MLIR\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7b80\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "MLIR-Forge\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u521b\u5efa\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9690\u85cf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMLIR-Forge\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e3aMLIR\u5185\u7f6e\u65b9\u8a00\u3001WebAssembly\u548cDaCe\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b09\u4e2aMLIR\u300115\u4e2aWebAssembly\u548c774\u4e2aDaCe\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "MLIR-Forge\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6027\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668IR\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
