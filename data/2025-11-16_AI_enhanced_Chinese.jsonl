Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky).

This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.\n  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.\n  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u5168\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3ML\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982GADTs\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u8f7d\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "ML\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6709\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u4e00\u822c\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u800c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6784\u9020\u5a01\u80c1\u4e86\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u62d2\u7edd\u672c\u5e94\u7c7b\u578b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u6682\u505c\u5339\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u201d\u548c\u201c\u589e\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u201d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u6c42\u89e3\u7c7b\u578b\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OCaml\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u8f7d\u8bb0\u5f55\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u534a\u663e\u5f0f\u4e00\u7b49\u591a\u6001\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u548c\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u7279\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eOCaml\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u3002"}}

While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics.

Much of the research has concentrated on fairness, with comparatively less attention given to other important aspects. Chen et al. (2010) introduced an algorithm that, in addition to ensuring fairness, was strategyproof -- meaning agents had no incentive to misreport their valuations. However, even in the absence of strategic incentives to misreport, agents may still hesitate to reveal their true preferences due to privacy concerns (e.g., when allocating advertising time between firms, revealing preferences could inadvertently expose planned marketing strategies or product launch timelines). In this work, we extend the strategyproof algorithm of Chen et al. by introducing a privacy-preserving dimension. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first private cake-cutting protocol, and, in addition, this protocol is also envy-free and strategyproof. Our approach replaces the algorithm's centralized computation with a novel adaptation of cryptographic techniques, enabling privacy without compromising fairness or strategyproofness. Thus, our protocol encourages agents to report their true preferences not only because they are not incentivized to lie, but also because they are protected from having their preferences exposed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Chen\u7b49\u4eba\uff082010\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u86cb\u7cd5\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u86cb\u7cd5\u5206\u914d\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u86cb\u7cd5\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5173\u6ce8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u91cd\u89c6\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u62c5\u5fc3\u6cc4\u9732\u5546\u4e1a\u673a\u5bc6\u800c\u4e0d\u613f\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u88ab\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u86cb\u7cd5\u5206\u914d\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9f13\u52b1\u4ee3\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u86cb\u7cd5\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With $n$ symmetric agents, a natural benchmark for each agent is the utility realized by her favorite $1/n$-fraction of rounds; a line of work has demonstrated one can robustly guarantee each agent a constant fraction of this ideal utility, irrespective of how other agents behave. In particular, several mechanisms have been shown to be $1/2$-robust, and recent work established that repeated first-price auctions based on artificial credits have a robustness factor of $0.59$, which cannot be improved beyond $0.6$ using first-price and simple strategies. In contrast, even without strategic considerations, the best achievable factor is $1-1/e\\approx 0.63$.\n  In this work, we break the $0.6$ first-price barrier to get a new $0.625$-robust mechanism, which almost closes the gap to the non-strategic robustness bound. Surprisingly, we do so via a simple auction, where in each round, bidders decide if they ask for the item, and we allocate uniformly at random among those who ask. The main new ingredient is the idea of competitive subsidies, wherein we charge the winning agent an amount in artificial credits that decreases when fewer agents are bidding (specifically, when $k$ agents bid, then the winner pays proportional to $k/(k+1)$, varying the payment by a factor of 2 depending on the competition). Moreover, we show how it can be modified to get an equilibrium strategy with a slightly weaker robust guarantee of $5/(3e) \\approx 0.61$ (and the optimal $1-1/e$ factor at equilibrium). Finally, we show that our mechanism gives the best possible bound under a wide class of auction-based mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.625\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u754c\u96500.63\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u9996\u6b21\u4ef7\u683c\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a0.6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u503c0.63\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6295\u6807\u8005\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u7ade\u6807\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u7ade\u4e89\u8865\u8d34\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u83b7\u80dc\u8005\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u91d1\u989d\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.625\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f30.61\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u652f\u4ed8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4ef7\u683c\u62cd\u5356\u76840.6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We depart from Uncapacitated Facility Location and by assuming that the connection costs of agents to facilities are congestion dependent, we define a novel problem, namely, Facility Location for Congesting (Selfish) Commuters. The connection costs of agents to facilities come as a result of how the agents commute to reach the facilities in an underlying network with cost functions on the edges. Inapproximability results follow from the related literature and thus approximate solutions is all we can hope for. For when the cost functions are nondecreasing we employ in a novel way an approximate version of Caratheodory's Theorem [5] to show how approximate solutions for different versions of the problem can be derived. For when the cost functions are nonincreasing we show how this problem generalizes the Cost-Distance problem [38] and provide an algorithm that for this more general case achieves the same approximation guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u62e5\u5835\uff08\u81ea\u79c1\uff09\u901a\u52e4\u8005\u7684\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4e0e\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\u968f\u62e5\u5835\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\u51fa\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\u968f\u62e5\u5835\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5f53\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u9012\u51cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7248\u7684Caratheodory\u5b9a\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff1b\u5f53\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u9012\u589e\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5e7f\u6210\u672c-\u8ddd\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u9012\u51cf\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u9012\u589e\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62e5\u5835\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002"}}
