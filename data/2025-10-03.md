*Changmin Lee,Jihyun Lee,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MPMAvatar是一个从多视角视频创建3D人体化身的框架，支持高度真实、鲁棒的动画以及自由视角的光线级渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明，MPMAvatar在动力学建模准确性、渲染精度及鲁棒性和效率方面显著优于现有基于物理的化身方法。并能零样本泛化到未见过的交互场景。

Conclusion: MPMAvatar通过整合精确的动力学建模和高保真渲染技术，为3D化身创建提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，扩展了物理模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

### [2] [Multimodal Feedback for Task Guidance in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01690)
*Hu Guo,Lily Patel,Rohan Gupt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 研究表明，结合视觉和触觉反馈的OST-AR系统在深度引导任务中显著提高空间精度和可用性，优于单一视觉或触觉条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OST-AR系统在深度感知中依赖视觉叠加可能导致注意力过载和深度线索不足，尤其是在遮挡或光线不足的情况下。

Method: 设计了一种带有六个振动马达的自定义腕带，结合手持工具和OST-AR，评估其在认知负载下的触觉模式识别和深度引导效果。

Result: 通过两项实验，参与者能够准确识别触觉模式，并且多模态反馈在空间精度和可用性上优于单一模态。

Conclusion: 多模态反馈（视觉+触觉）在深度引导任务中具有明显优势，为OST-AR系统的改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

### [3] [MIRAGE: Patient-Specific Mixed Reality Coaching for MRI via Depth-Only Markerless Registration and Immersive VR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01743)
*Daniel Brooks,Emily Carter,Hu Guo,Rajesh Nair*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MIRAGE系统，利用混合现实技术帮助患者缓解MRI检查中的焦虑和幽闭恐惧症，并通过沉浸式虚拟现实和无标记增强现实技术提高患者体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI检查的封闭空间和噪音容易导致患者焦虑和幽闭恐惧症，进而引发运动伪影和不完整的扫描结果，甚至需要药物镇静。MIRAGE系统旨在通过混合现实技术解决这些问题。

Method: MIRAGE系统采用混合现实硬件，结合沉浸式虚拟现实和无标记增强现实注册技术，为患者提供MRI前的准备体验。论文详细介绍了系统架构和临床部署的考虑因素。

Result: 深度注册技术实现了亚厘米级的精确度且设置简便，沉浸式指导环境显著降低了患者的焦虑并获得了较高的可用性评分。

Conclusion: MIRAGE系统通过混合现实技术有效改善了患者在MRI检查中的体验，展示了其在临床工作流程中部署的潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

### [4] [ROI-GS: Interest-based Local Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01978)
*Quoc-Anh Bui,Gilles Rougeron,Géraldine Morin,Simone Gasparini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ROI-GS是专为提升三维场景中感兴趣区域（ROI）细节的对象感知框架，通过对象引导的相机选择、针对性训练和高保真重建，显著优化局部质量并减小模型体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现存的三维高斯投影（3DGS）方法资源分配均匀，导致感兴趣区域细节受限且模型体积庞大，ROI-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ROI-GS采用对象感知框架，包括对象引导的相机选择、针对性对象训练和全局场景中的高保真重建无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明，ROI-GS在局部质量上提升显著（PSNR最高2.96 dB），模型体积减少约17%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: ROI-GS在提升感兴趣区域细节的同时，显著减小模型体积并保持实时性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

### [5] [Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069)
*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可重新照明的框架，结合微表面BRDF和2D高斯泼溅技术，实现了高质量的几何和材质重建，提升了在新光照条件下的重照明效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法通常依赖于简化的BRDF模型或参数化方法，限制了材质的忠实重建和重照明的逼真度。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种将微表面BRDF与2D高斯泼溅结合的框架，采用递进式着色，并使用扩散先验引导早期优化以减少模糊性。

Result: 在复杂光泽场景上的大量实验表明，该方法能够实现高质量的几何和材质重建，并在新光照条件下提供更逼真和一致的重照明效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合微表面BRDF和高斯泼溅技术，显著提升了材质分解的物理一致性，并在重照明任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

### [6] [Learning to Play Multi-Follower Bayesian Stackelberg Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01387)
*Gerson Personnat,Tao Lin,Safwan Hossain,David C. Parkes*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了多跟随者贝叶斯Stackelberg游戏中的在线学习问题，领导者通过与跟随者交互优化策略，设计了在不同反馈设置下的学习算法，并分析了其遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多跟随者贝叶斯Stackelberg游戏中，领导者的最优策略依赖于跟随者私有类型的分布。然而，实际中这一分布往往是未知的，因此需要研究在线学习版本的问题，以最小化遗憾。

Method: 设计了在不同反馈设置下的学习算法：类型反馈下，领导者能观察到跟随者的类型；行动反馈下，只能观察到跟随者的行动。算法分析了独立类型分布和一般类型分布的情况。

Result: 在类型反馈下，算法实现了非多项式增长于跟随者数量的遗憾边界；在行动反馈下，设计了更高的遗憾边界算法，并提供了与之匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在多跟随者贝叶斯Stackelberg游戏中，不同类型反馈的在线学习算法能有效优化领导者的策略，遗憾边界设计与反馈方式密切相关。

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

### [7] [Designing Inferable Signaling Schemes for Bayesian Persuasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01434)
*Caleb Probine,Mustafa O. Karabag,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了贝叶斯说服中接收者通过重复交互推断信号方案的情境，相比经典的已知承诺模型，发送者的性能损失受信号空间大小和接收者最优动作差异的影响。论文还提出了两种设计可推断信号方案的方法，并在安全警报示例中验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的贝叶斯说服模型假设接收者知道发送者的承诺，而现实中接收者需要通过重复交互推断信号方案。本文旨在探索这种推断情境下发送者的性能损失及其设计可推断方案的可行性。

Method: 论文分析了发送者在推断情境下的性能损失，并通过采样复杂度给出了近似已知承诺性能的下界。提出了两种设计可推断信号方案的方法：在发送者的推断效用上应用随机梯度下降（SGD），以及基于有限理性接收者模型的优化。

Result: 研究发现，发送者在说服情境中所需的样本量多于Stackelberg游戏中的领导者。SGD在低交互场景中表现最佳，而有限理性接收者模型则为设计可推断方案提供了灵活性。在安全警报示例中，SGD设计的方案信号更少且公民最优动作更明显。

Conclusion: 论文表明，在接收者推断信号方案的情境下，发送者可以通过SGD或有限理性接收者模型设计高效的信号方案，并在实际应用中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: In Bayesian persuasion, an informed sender, who observes a state, commits to
a randomized signaling scheme that guides a self-interested receiver's actions.
Classical models assume the receiver knows the commitment. We, instead, study
the setting where the receiver infers the scheme from repeated interactions. We
bound the sender's performance loss relative to the known-commitment case by a
term that grows with the signal space size and shrinks as the receiver's
optimal actions become more distinct. We then lower bound the samples required
for the sender to approximately achieve their known-commitment performance in
the inference setting. We show that the sender requires more samples in
persuasion compared to the leader in a Stackelberg game, which includes
commitment but lacks signaling. Motivated by these bounds, we propose two
methods for designing inferable signaling schemes, one being stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) on the sender's inference-setting utility, and the other
being optimization with a boundedly-rational receiver model. SGD performs best
in low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and
tuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing
inferable schemes. Finally, we apply SGD to a safety alert example and show it
to find schemes that have fewer signals and make citizens' optimal actions more
distinct compared to the known-commitment case.

### [8] [Incentive Analysis of Collusion in Fair Division](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01689)
*Haoqiang Huang,Biaoshuai Tao,Mingwei Yang,Shengwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了策略性代理在公平分配问题中的合谋操纵行为，定义了SGIR和GIR来衡量合谋操纵的收益，并分析了MNW、PS和RR机制的GIR和SGIR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究策略性代理在公平分配问题中通过合谋操纵获得的收益差异，填补了之前研究中关于群体合谋操纵的空缺。

Method: 定义了SGIR和GIR两种指标来衡量合谋操纵的收益，并分析了MNW、PS和RR机制的GIR和SGIR随联盟规模的变化。

Result: MNW的GIR始终为2，与联盟规模无关；MNW和PS的SGIR以及PS和RR的GIR在联盟规模c≥1时为c+1；而RR的SGIR在c≥2时无界。

Conclusion: 揭示了MNW、PS和RR三种机制在对抗合谋操纵时的差异性，为进一步研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study fair division problems with strategic agents capable of gaining
advantages by manipulating their reported preferences. Although several
impossibility results have revealed the incompatibility of truthfulness with
standard fairness criteria, subsequent works have circumvented this limitation
through the incentive ratio framework. Previous studies demonstrate that
fundamental mechanisms like Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) and Probabilistic Serial
(PS) for divisible goods, and Round-Robin (RR) for indivisible goods achieve an
incentive ratio of $2$, implying that no individual agent can gain more than
double his truthful utility through manipulation. However, collusive
manipulation by agent groups remains unexplored.
  In this work, we define strong group incentive ratio (SGIR) and group
incentive ratio (GIR) to measure the gain of collusive manipulation, where SGIR
and GIR are respectively the maximum and minimum of the incentive ratios of
corrupted agents. Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS,
and RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size.
Moreover, for coalition size $c \geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs
of PS and RR are $c + 1$. Finally, the SGIR of RR is unbounded for coalition
size $c \geq 2$. Our results reveal fundamental differences of these three
mechanisms in their vulnerability to collusion.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithm to approximate the core of transferable
utility (TU) cooperative games via linear programming. Given the computational
hardness of determining the full core, our approach provides a tractable
approximation by sampling extreme points through randomized linear problems

its effectiveness through extensive simulations on various game models. Our
results show that the method is scalable and achieves high accuracy in terms of
core reconstruction.

### [10] [Multi-group Bayesian Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02078)
*Hongxing Yuan,Xuan Zhang,Chunyu Wei,Yushun Fan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多组贝叶斯博弈（MBG）模型来描述贝叶斯博弈中的群体行为，并通过提出的转换方法找到其（强）多组贝叶斯纳什均衡（MBNE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决贝叶斯博弈中群体行为的建模问题，该论文引入了MBG模型，并探讨了在不同合作与非合作情境下的最优策略。

Method: 论文首先提出MBG模型和一个转换方法，将MBG转换为多组事前代理博弈（MEAG），这是一个标准形式的博弈。然后给出了MBG的MEAG是否为（强）势博弈的充分必要条件。

Result: 如果MEAG是（强）势博弈，则可以找到其所有（强）纳什均衡，并通过转换的良好性质获得MBG的所有（强）MBNE。论文还提供了算法并通过示例验证了结果的正确性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法和转换技术为在多组贝叶斯博弈中寻找均衡策略提供了有效的途径，并通过理论和实例验证了其可行性和正确性。

Abstract: This paper presents a model of multi-group Bayesian games (MBGs) to describe
the group behavior in Bayesian games, and gives methods to find (strongly)
multi-group Bayesian Nash equilibria (MBNE) of this model with a proposed
transformation. MBNE represent the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the
situation where players within a group play a cooperative game, while strongly
MBNE characterize the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation
where players within a group play a noncooperative game. Firstly, we propose a
model of MBGs and give a transformation to convert any MBG into a multi-group
ex-ante agent game (MEAG) which is a normal-form game. Secondly, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for a MBG's MEAG to be (strongly) potential.
If it is (strongly) potential, all its (strongly) Nash equilibria can be found,
and then all (strongly) MBNE of the MBG can be obtained by leveraging the
transformation's good properties. Finally, we provide algorithms for finding
(strongly) MBNE of a MBG whose MEAG is (strongly) potential and use an
illustrative example to verify the correctness of our results.
