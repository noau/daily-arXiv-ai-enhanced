In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PartMotionEdit\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a83D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPartMotionEdit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bPart-aware Motion Modulation (PMM)\u6a21\u5757\u548cBidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e5\u540d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cPartMotionEdit\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PartMotionEdit\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues.

For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agent-C\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u9075\u5b88\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "Agent-C\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u5ba2\u670d\u548c\u673a\u7968\u9884\u8ba2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAgent-C\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent-C\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting.

Primary category cs.PL, secondary cs.DC", "summary": "The Virtual Garbage Collector (VGC) introduces a novel memory management framework designed to optimize performance across diverse systems, ranging from resource constrained embedded devices to high performance parallel architectures. Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u865a\u62df\u5783\u573e\u56de\u6536\u5668\uff08VGC\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5783\u573e\u56de\u6536\u5668\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002VGC\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VGC\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\uff1aActive VGC\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u53d1\u7684\u6807\u8bb0-\u6e05\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6682\u505c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1bPassive VGC\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u788e\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVGC\u5c06\u6682\u505c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1130%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u603b\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1125%\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VGC\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

When designing online participatory platforms to support digital democracy initiatives enabling citizens to deliberate over such proposals, we might wish to equip those platforms with the functionality to retrieve the most divisive proposals currently under discussion. Such a service would be useful for analysing the progress of deliberation and steering discussion towards issues that still require further debate. Guided by this use case, we explore possibilities for providing a clear definition of what it means to select a set of most divisive proposals on the basis of people's stated preferences over proposals. Then, employing the axiomatic method familiar from social choice theory, we show that the task of selecting the most divisive proposals in a manner that satisfies certain seemingly mild normative requirements faces a number of fundamental difficulties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u6848\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5177\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b57\u6c11\u4e3b\u5021\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5177\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5f15\u5bfc\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u67d0\u4e9b\u770b\u4f3c\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u65f6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5206\u6b67\u63d0\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u5b57\u6c11\u4e3b\u5e73\u53f0\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e89\u8bae\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This quantity informs two practical questions for enumeration-based model checking: how long a model checking run is likely to take, and what fraction of the search space has been covered so far. We first show the counting problem is #P-hard even for restricted programs and, unless $P=NP$, inapproximable within any subexponential factor, ruling out efficient exact or randomized approximation algorithms. We give a Monte Carlo approach to obtain a poly-time unbiased estimator: we convert a stateless optimal DPOR algorithm into an unbiased estimator by viewing its exploration as a bounded-depth, bounded-width tree whose leaves are the maximal Mazurkiewicz traces. A classical estimator by Knuth, when run on this tree, yields an unbiased estimate. To control the variance, we apply stochastic enumeration by maintaining a small population of partial paths per depth whose evolution is coupled. We have implemented our estimator in the JMC model checker and evaluated it on shared-memory benchmarks. With modest budgets, our estimator yields stable estimates, typically within a 20% band, within a few hundred trials, even when the state space has $10^5$--$10^6$ classes. We also show how the same machinery estimates model-checking cost by weighting all explored graphs, not only complete traces. Our algorithms provide the first provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces, a problem of considerable importance when allocating model checking resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e76\u53d1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u7b97Mazurkiewicz\u8ff9\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u679a\u4e3e\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e76\u53d1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2dMazurkiewicz\u8ff9\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u6700\u4f18DPOR\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Knuth\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u968f\u673a\u679a\u4e3e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728JMC\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u901a\u5e38\u572820%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u8fbe10^5--10^6\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
