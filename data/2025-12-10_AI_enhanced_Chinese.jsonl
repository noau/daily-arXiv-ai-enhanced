Companion to Agentic Capital. Submitted to establish priority", "summary": "This paper develops the Theory of Strategic Evolution, a general model for systems in which the population of players, strategies, and institutional rules evolve together. The theory extends replicator dynamics to settings with endogenous players, multi level selection, innovation, constitutional change, and meta governance. The central mathematical object is a Poiesis stack: a hierarchy of strategic layers linked by cross level gain matrices. Under small gain conditions, the system admits a global Lyapunov function and satisfies selection, tracking, and stochastic stability results at every finite depth. We prove that the class is closed under block extension, innovation events, heterogeneous utilities, continuous strategy spaces, and constitutional evolution. The closure theorem shows that no new dynamics arise at higher levels and that unrestricted self modification cannot preserve Lyapunov structure. The theory unifies results from evolutionary game theory, institutional design, innovation dynamics, and constitutional political economy, providing a general mathematical model of long run strategic adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u2018\u6218\u7565\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u2019\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5185\u751f\u73a9\u5bb6\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u8fc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u2018Poiesis\u5806\u6808\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u73a9\u5bb6\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018Poiesis\u5806\u6808\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ea7\u589e\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\u548cLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c0f\u589e\u76ca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c0f\u589e\u76ca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5305\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u6218\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We consider mechanisms for privacy-aware users whose utility depends not only on the outcome of the mechanism but also negatively on the exposure of their economic preferences. Specifically, we study two auction-theoretic settings with privacy-aware users. First, we analyze an order flow auction, where a user auctions off to specialized agents, called searchers, the right to execute her transaction while maintaining a degree of privacy. We examine how the degree of privacy affects the revenue of the auction and, broadly, the net utility of the privacy-aware user. In this new setting, we describe the optimal auction, which is a sealed-bid auction. Subsequently, we analyze a variant of a Dutch auction in which the user gradually decreases the price and the degree of privacy until the transaction is sold. We compare the revenue of this auction to that of the optimal one as a function of the number of communication rounds. Then, we introduce a two-sided market - a privacy marketplace - with multiple users selling their transactions under their privacy preferences to multiple searchers. We propose a posted-price mechanism for the two-sided market that guarantees constant approximation of the optimal social welfare while maintaining incentive compatibility (from both sides of the market) and budget balance. This work builds on the emerging line of research that attempts to improve the performance of economic mechanisms by appending cryptographic primitives to them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u610f\u8bc6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u4f18\u62cd\u5356\u548c\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u610f\u8bc6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u62cd\u5356\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff1a\u8ba2\u5355\u6d41\u62cd\u5356\u548c\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\uff08\u9690\u79c1\u5e02\u573a\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u62cd\u5356\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bc6\u5c01\u7ade\u4ef7\u62cd\u5356\u3002\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

While traditional models of spectrum auctions often rely on strong equilibrium assumptions, we take a more parsimonious approach by modeling bidders as myopic and straightforward: in each round, firms simply demand the bundle that maximizes their utility given current prices. Despite its simplicity, this model proves effective in predicting the outcomes of Canada's 2023 auction of 3800 MHz spectrum licenses. Using detailed round-by-round bidding data, we estimate bidders' valuations through a linear programming framework and validate that our model reproduces key features of the observed allocation and price evolution. We then use these estimated valuations to simulate a counterfactual auction under an alternative mechanism that incentivizes deployment in rural and remote regions, aligning with one of the key objectives set out in the Canadian Telecommunications Act. The results show that the proposed mechanism substantially improves population coverage in underserved areas. These findings demonstrate that a behavioral model with minimal assumptions is sufficient to generate reliable counterfactual predictions, making it a practical tool for policymakers to evaluate how alternative auction designs may influence future outcomes. In particular, our study demonstrates a method for counterfactual mechanism design, providing a framework to evaluate how alternative auction rules could advance policy goals such as equitable deployment across Canada.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u62cd\u5356\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u52a0\u62ff\u59272023\u5e743800 MHz\u9891\u8c31\u8bb8\u53ef\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u7ade\u4ef7\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u7b97\u6295\u6807\u8005\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u8c31\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5747\u8861\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u62cd\u5356\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6295\u6807\u8005\u7684\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7ade\u4ef7\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u6f14\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u52a0\u62ff\u59273800 MHz\u9891\u8c31\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u519c\u6751\u548c\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u66ff\u4ee3\u62cd\u5356\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Specifically, we analyze two stochastic models of regularized learning in continuous games -- one in continuous and one in discrete time with the aim of characterizing the long-run behavior of the induced sequence of play. In stark contrast to deterministic, full-information models of learning (or models with a vanishing learning rate), we show that the resulting dynamics do not converge in general. In lieu of this, we ask instead which actions are played more often in the long run, and by how much. We show that, in strongly monotone games, the dynamics of regularized learning may wander away from equilibrium infinitely often, but they always return to its vicinity in finite time (which we estimate), and their long-run distribution is sharply concentrated around a neighborhood thereof. We quantify the degree of this concentration, and we show that these favorable properties may all break down if the underlying game is not strongly monotone -- underscoring in this way the limits of regularized learning in the presence of persistent randomness and uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u822c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u9891\u7e41\u8fd4\u56de\u5747\u8861\u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u9891\u7e41\u8fd4\u56de\u5747\u8861\u90bb\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Starting with the former, we introduce the notion of a robust equilibrium as those equilibria that remain invariant to small -- but otherwise arbitrary -- perturbations to the game's payoff structure, and we provide a crisp geometric characterization thereof. Subsequently, we turn to the question of dynamic robustness, and we examine which equilibria may arise as stable limit points of the dynamics of \"follow the regularized leader\" (FTRL) in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. Despite their very distinct origins, we establish a structural correspondence between these two notions of robustness: strategic robustness implies dynamic robustness, and, conversely, the requirement of strategic robustness cannot be relaxed if dynamic robustness is to be maintained. Finally, we examine the rate of convergence to robust equilibria as a function of the underlying regularizer, and we show that entropically regularized learning converges at a geometric rate in games with affinely constrained action spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5728\u6218\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63a2\u8ba8\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5728\u6218\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5747\u8861\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5065\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u6536\u76ca\u7ed3\u6784\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76FTRL\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4eff\u5c04\u7ea6\u675f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
