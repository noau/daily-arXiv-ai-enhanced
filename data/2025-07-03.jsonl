We define a notion of causal\nembedding and prove a closure principle: any subsystem that participates\nfunctionally in the computation of an undecidable system inherits its\nundecidability. This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint\non prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial\nsystems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that\ncomputational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation. By\ngeneralizing classical results into a dynamic systems context, this work\naugments the logical trajectory of G\\\"odel, Turing, and Chaitin, offering a new\nperspective of the topology of computability and its interrelation to the\nboundaries of scientific knowledge."}

Vazirani and Yannakakis [ICALP 1992] designed the first algorithm for\ncomputing an (s,t)-cut of second minimum capacity using $O(n^2)$ maximum\n(s,t)-flow computations. For directed integer-weighted graphs, we significantly\nimprove this bound by designing an algorithm that computes an $(s,t)$-cut of\nsecond minimum capacity using $O(\\sqrt{n})$ maximum (s,t)-flow computations\nw.h.p. To achieve this result, a close relationship of independent interest is\nestablished between $(s,t)$-cuts of second minimum capacity and global mincuts\nin directed weighted graphs.\n  2. Minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts have been studied quite well recently [Baswana,\nBhanja, and Pandey, ICALP 2022], which is a special case of second\n(s,t)-mincut.\n  (a) For directed multi-graphs, we design an algorithm that, given any maximum\n(s,t)-flow, computes a minimum+1 (s,t)-cut, if it exists, in $O(m)$ time.\n  (b) The existing structures for storing and characterizing all minimum+1\n(s,t)-cuts occupy $O(mn)$ space. For undirected multi-graphs, we design a DAG\noccupying only $O(m)$ space that stores and characterizes all minimum+1\n(s,t)-cuts.\n  3. The study of minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts often turns out to be useful in\ndesigning dual edge sensitivity oracles -- a compact data structure for\nefficiently reporting an (s,t)-mincut after insertion/failure of any given pair\nof query edges. It has been shown recently [Bhanja, ICALP 2025] that any dual\nedge sensitivity oracle for (s,t)-mincut in undirected multi-graphs must occupy\n${\\Omega}(n^2)$ space in the worst-case, irrespective of the query time. For\nsimple graphs, we break this quadratic barrier while achieving a non-trivial\nquery time."}

In the late 1990s efforts to\nindividualize dosing emerged fleetingly in the oncology trial methods\nliterature, but these have gained little traction due to a nexus of conceptual,\ntechnical, commercial, and regulatory barriers. To reduce the activation energy\nneeded for transforming current 1-size-fits-all dose-escalation trial designs\nto the dose-titration designs required for patient-centered dose\nindividualization, we demonstrate a categorical formulation of dose-escalation\nprotocols that extends readily to allow gradual introduction of dose titration.\n  Central to this formulation is a symmetric monoidal preorder on the\naccessible states of dose-escalation trials, embodying pharmacologic intuitions\nregarding dose-monotonicity of drug toxicity and ethical intuitions relating to\nthe therapeutic intent of such trials. A trial protocol that assigns doses to\nenrolling participants consistently with these intuitions is then a monotone\nmap from this preorder to the sequence of doses being trialed. We illustrate\nthis formulation by reference to the ubiquitous 3+3 dose-escalation design,\nwhich despite its many widely discussed flaws remains familiar to oncology\ntrialists and moreover has available an executable specification in Prolog.\nRemarkably, examined in light of our preorder the 3+3 protocol discloses a new\nflaw not previously described: a non-monotone dose recommendation. The right\nKan extension approximates this protocol from the side of safety, dissolving\nits triplet cohorts to allow incremental enrollment, and rectifying said\nnon-monotonicity. It also facilitates accelerated enrollment while toxicity\nassessments remain pending, as well as discretionary dose titration."}

However,\nexplaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored\nand challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the\ncounterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially,\ngiven two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than\n$B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$\nsuch that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of\n$A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always\nexist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte\nCarlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according\nto the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley\nvalues of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a\nseries of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating\ndifferential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and\nshifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our\nexperimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our\nmethod and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley\nvalue of an owner."}

However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on\npartitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at\nchunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly\nsuited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with\nstreet-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU\nmemory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering.

Furthermore, we note that to ensure the\nsuccess of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by\nthe colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship\nattack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect\nequilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and\nprotocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures."}

Visual and haptic guidance mechanisms ensure context\npreservation during multi-scale interaction. We demonstrate and discuss the\nusability of our technique for the editing of network data."}

We prove that standard flavors of LTL can\nbe embedded in our framework. The library also provides automation for\nreasoning about LeanLTL formulas in a way that facilitates using Lean's\nexisting tactics.

We define a notion of causal\nembedding and prove a closure principle: any subsystem that participates\nfunctionally in the computation of an undecidable system inherits its\nundecidability. This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint\non prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial\nsystems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that\ncomputational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation. By\ngeneralizing classical results into a dynamic systems context, this work\naugments the logical trajectory of G\\\"odel, Turing, and Chaitin, offering a new\nperspective of the topology of computability and its interrelation to the\nboundaries of scientific knowledge."}
