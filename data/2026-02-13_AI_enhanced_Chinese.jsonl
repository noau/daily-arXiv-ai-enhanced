This requirement is crucial when the point cloud must lie non-negotiably on the final surface to preserve sharp features and fine geometric details. However, the task becomes substantially challenging with low-quality point clouds, due to inherent reconstruction ambiguities compounded by combinatorial complexity. A previous method using filmsticking technique by iteratively compute restricted Voronoi diagram to address these issues, ensures to produce a watertight manifold, setting a new benchmark as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Unfortunately, RVD-based filmsticking is inability to interpolate all points in the case of deep internal cavities, resulting in very likely is the generation of faulty topology. The cause of this issue is that RVD-based filmsticking has inherent limitations due to Euclidean distance metrics. In this paper, we extend the filmsticking technique, named Filmsticking++. Filmsticking++ reconstructing an explicit surface from points without normals. On one hand, Filmsticking++ break through the inherent limitations of Euclidean distance by employing a weighted-distance-based Restricted Power Diagram, which guarantees that all points are interpolated. On the other hand, we observe that as the guiding surface increasingly approximates the target shape, the external medial axis is gradually expelled outside the guiding surface. Building on this observation, we propose placing virtual sites inside the guiding surface to accelerate the expulsion of the external medial axis from its interior. To summarize, contrary to the SOTA method, Filmsticking++ demonstrates multiple benefits, including decreases computational cost, improved robustness and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFilmsticking++\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a0\u6743\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9650\u5236\u529f\u7387\u56fe\uff08RPD\uff09\u548c\u865a\u62df\u7ad9\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RVD-based filmsticking\u5728\u6df1\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u8154\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d2\u503c\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d7\u9650Voronoi\u56fe\uff08RVD\uff09\u7684filmsticking\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u8154\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d2\u503c\u6240\u6709\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "Filmsticking++\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9650\u5236\u529f\u7387\u56fe\uff08RPD\uff09\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u90fd\u80fd\u88ab\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u4e2d\u8f74\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u8868\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u65f6\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u88ab\u6392\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u8868\u9762\u5185\u90e8\u653e\u7f6e\u865a\u62df\u7ad9\u70b9\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "Filmsticking++\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684RVD-based filmsticking\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u7684\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Filmsticking++\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u865a\u62df\u7ad9\u70b9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain.

We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360\u00b0 full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360\u00b0-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360\u00b0 full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion.

This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56.

The simplest mode of non-convergence is cyclical or periodic behavior. Such cycles are fundamental objects, and have inspired a number of significant insights in the field, beginning with the pioneering work of Shapley (1964). However a central question remains unanswered: which cycles are stable under game dynamics? In this paper we give a complete and computational answer to this question for the two best-studied dynamics, fictitious play/best-response dynamics and the replicator dynamic. We show (1) that a periodic sequence of profiles is stable under one of these dynamics if and only it is stable under the other, and (2) we provide a polynomial-time spectral stability test to determine whether a given periodic sequence is stable under either dynamic. Finally, we give an entirely `structural' sufficient condition for stability: every cycle that is a sink equilibrium of the preference graph of the game is stable, and moreover it is an attractor of the replicator dynamic. This result generalizes the famous theorems of Shapley (1964) and Jordan (1993), and extends the frontier of recent work relating the preference graph to the replicator attractors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u865a\u6784\u73a9\u6cd5/\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86Shapley\uff081964\uff09\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u865a\u6784\u73a9\u6cd5\u548c\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u6c47\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5468\u671f\u90fd\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u662f\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Shapley\u548cJordan\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}

Here, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion and resolving its existence is regarded as one of the most important open problems in this area of research. Two prominent relaxations of EFX are envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) and epistemic EFX (EEFX). While allocations satisfying each of these notions individually are known to exist even for general monotone valuations, whether both can be satisfied simultaneously remains open for all instances in which the EFX problem is itself unresolved.\n  In this work, we show that there always exists an allocation that is both EF1 (in fact, the stronger notion EFL) and EEFX for additive valuations, thereby resolving the primary open question raised by Akrami and Rathi (2025) and bringing us one step closer to resolving the elusive EFX problem. We introduce a new share-based fairness notion, termed strong EEFX share, which may be of independent interest and which implies EEFX feasibility of bundles.

Yet, almost all fast convergence guarantees in learning in games require prior knowledge of the utility scale. To address this, we develop learning dynamics that achieve fast convergence while being both scale-free, requiring no prior information about utilities, and scale-invariant, remaining unchanged under positive rescaling of utilities. For two-player zero-sum games, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with external regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}})$, where $A_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ is the payoff range, which implies an $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}} / T)$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium after $T$ rounds. For multiplayer general-sum games with $n$ players and $m$ actions, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with swap regret bounded by $O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T)$, where $U_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the range of the utilities, ignoring the dependence on the number of players and actions. This yields an $O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T / T)$ convergence rate to correlated equilibrium. Our learning dynamics are based on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with an adaptive learning rate that incorporates the squared path length of the opponents' gradient vectors, together with a new stopping-time analysis that exploits negative terms in regret bounds without scale-dependent tuning.

Unfortunately, for regular distributions, adding $m$ additional buyers is sometimes indeed necessary, so the \"competition complexity\" of the VCG auction is $m$. We seek proving better competition complexity results in two dimensions.\n  First, under stronger distributional assumptions, the competition complexity of VCG auction drops dramatically. In balanced markets (where $m=n$) with MHR distributions, it is sufficient to only add $(e^{1/e} - 1 + o(1))n \\approx 0.4447n$ additional buyers to match the optimal revenue -- less than half the number that is necessary under regularity -- and this bound is asymptotically tight. We provide both exact finite-market results for small value of $n$, and closed-form asymptotic formulas for general market with any $m\\leq n$, and any target fraction of the optimal revenue.\n  Second, we analyze a supply-limiting variant of VCG auction that caps the number of units sold in a prior-independent way. Whenever the goal is to achieve almost the optimal revenue, this mechanism strictly improves upon standard VCG auction, requiring significantly fewer additional buyers.\n  Together, our results show that both stronger distributional assumptions, as well as a simple prior-independent refinement to the VCG auction, can each substantially reduce the number of additional buyers that is sufficient to achieve (near-)optimal revenue.

We study the Pareto frontier of the set of seller-buyers ex-ante utilities, generated by all truthful mechanisms when buyers values are sampled independently and identically (i.i.d.). We first provide a complete structural characterization of the Pareto frontier under natural distributional assumptions. For example, when valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, every Pareto-optimal mechanism is a second-price auction with a reserve no larger than the monopoly reserve.\n  Building on this, we interpret the problem of picking a mechanism as a two-sided bargaining game, and analyze two canonical Pareto-optimal solutions from cooperative bargaining theory: the Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) solution, and the Nash solution. We prove that when values are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, in large markets both solutions yield near-optimal welfare. In contrast, under worst-case MHR distributions, their performance diverges sharply: the KS solution guarantees one-half of the optimal welfare, while the Nash solution might only achieve an arbitrarily small fraction of it.

On each turn, participants privately decide whether to act manually or use the AI modality available in that game. Despite preferring the \\textit{Advisor} modality, participants achieve the highest mean individual gains with the \\textit{Delegate}, demonstrating a preference-performance misalignment. Moreover, delegation generates positive externalities; even non-adopting users in \\textit{access-to-delegate} treatment groups benefit by receiving higher-quality offers. Mechanism analysis reveals that the \\textit{Delegate} agent acts as a market maker, injecting rational, Pareto-improving proposals that restructure the trading environment. Our research reveals a gap between agent capabilities and realized group welfare.

However, because general anonymous contracts can suffer from multiple equilibria with unbounded gaps in principal utility, we identify uniform anonymous contracts as a desirable subclass. We prove that uniform anonymous contracts guarantee a unique equilibrium, thereby providing robust performance guarantees.\n  In terms of efficiency, we prove that under limited liability, anonymous contracts cannot generally approximate the social welfare better than a factor logarithmic in the spread of agent success probabilities. We show that uniform contracts are sufficient to match this theoretical limit. Finally, we demonstrate that removing limited liability significantly boosts performance: anonymous contracts generally achieve an $O(\\log n)$ approximation to the social welfare and, surprisingly, can extract the full welfare whenever agents' success probabilities are distinct.

We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i.e., first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. This insight also yields a simple proof of NE existence using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. We further show the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. Building on this characterization, we establish a policy gradient theorem for GUMGs and design a model-free policy gradient algorithm. For potential GUMGs, we establish iteration complexity guarantees for computing approximate-NE under exact gradients and provide sample complexity bounds in both the generative model and on-policy settings. Our results extend beyond prior work restricted to zero-sum cMGs, providing the first theoretical analysis of common-interest cMGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u6548\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\uff08GUMGs\uff09\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u51f8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u51f8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\uff08cMGs\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u5982\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55cMGs\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GUMGs\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBrouwer\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cGUMGs\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u652f\u914d\u6027\u8d28\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728GUMGs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5171\u540c\u5229\u76ca\u7684cMGs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3aGUMGs\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Participants, therefore, conduct a limited number of interviews, which provide early, noisy impressions and shape final decisions. We study bandit learning in matching markets with interviews, modeling interviews as \\textit{low-cost hints} that reveal partial preference information to both sides. Our framework departs from existing work by allowing firm-side uncertainty: firms, like agents, may be unsure of their own preferences and can make early hiring mistakes by hiring less preferred agents. To handle this, we extend the firm's action space to allow \\emph{strategic deferral} (choosing not to hire in a round), enabling recovery from suboptimal hires and supporting decentralized learning without coordination. We design novel algorithms for (i) a centralized setting with an omniscient interview allocator and (ii) decentralized settings with two types of firm-side feedback. Across all settings, our algorithms achieve time-independent regret, a substantial improvement over the $O(\\log T)$ regret bounds known for learning stable matchings without interviews.
