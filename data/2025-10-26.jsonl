Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose\nnatural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and\ninterpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,\ncomposable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such\nas +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic=\"Systems\nThinking\"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning\nstyle, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework\nformalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families\n(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed\ninto subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and\nsession-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic\nprocessing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By\ndecoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a\nreusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases\ndemonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and\nstandardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with\nimplications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development\nof declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems."}

In this position\npaper we contribute an initial characterization of the knowledge that an\nexecuting agent, human or machine, should possess in order to be able to carry\nout the instructions of a given algorithm specification as a stand-alone\nentity, independent of any system implementation. We argue that, for that\nalgorithm specification, such prerequisite knowledge, whether unique or shared\nwith other specifications, can be summarized in a document of practical size.\nWe term this document the realm of the algorithm specification. The generation\nof such a realm is itself a systematic analytical process, significant parts of\nwhich can be automated with the help of large language models and the reuse of\nexisting documents. The algorithm-specification's realm would consist of\nspecification language syntax and semantics, domain knowledge restricted to the\nreferenced entities, inter-entity relationships, relevant underlying\ncause-and-effect rules, and detailed instructions and means for carrying out\ncertain operations. Such characterization of the realm can contribute to\nmethodological implementation of the algorithm specification in diverse systems\nand to its formalization for mechanical verification. The paper also touches\nupon the question of assessing execution faithfulness, which is distinct from\ncorrectness: in the absence of a reference interpretation of natural language\nor pseudocode specification with a given vocabulary, how can we determine if an\nobserved agent's execution indeed complies with the input specification."}

Unfortunately,\nProto-Quipper languages have complex operational semantics: they are inherently\neffectful, and they rely on set-theoretic operations and fresh name generation\nto manipulate quantum circuits. This makes them difficult to reason about using\nstandard programming language techniques and, ultimately, to mechanize. We\nintroduce Proto-Quipper-A, a rational reconstruction of Proto-Quipper languages\nfor static circuit generation. It uses a linear $\\lambda$-calculus to describe\nquantum circuits with normal forms that closely correspond to box-and-wire\ncircuit diagrams. Adjoint-logical foundations integrate this circuit language\nwith a linear/non-linear functional language and let us reconstruct\nProto-Quipper's circuit programming abstractions using more primitive\nadjoint-logical operations. Proto-Quipper-A enjoys a simple call-by-value\nreduction semantics, and to illustrate its tractability as a foundation for\nProto-Quipper languages, we show that it is normalizing. We show how to use\nstandard logical relations to prove normalization of linear and substructural\nsystems, thereby avoiding the inherent complexity of existing linear logical\nrelations."}

While for traditional type systems\nexpressive variants with sophisticated inference algorithms have been developed\nand widely used in programming languages, type-and-effect systems did not yet\ngain widespread adoption. One reason for this is that type-and-effect systems\nare more complex and the existing inference algorithms make compromises between\nexpressiveness, intuitiveness, and decidability. In this work, we present an\neffect inference algorithm for a type-and-effect system with subtyping,\nexpressive higher-rank polymorphism, and intuitive set-like semantics of\neffects. In order to deal with scoping issues of higher-rank polymorphism, we\ndelay solving of effect constraints by transforming them into formulae of\npropositional logic. We prove soundness and completeness of our algorithm with\nrespect to a declarative type-and-effect system. All the presented results have\nbeen formalized in the Rocq proof assistant, and the algorithm has been\nsuccessfully implemented in a realistic programming language."}

Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but\nto translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert\nusers visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics\napproach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis\nof hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions\ninclude: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw\nimage data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs\nagainst a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate\nspatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix\nvisualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret\nrelationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical\ninsights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on\nevaluation with real-life image collections.

Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a\nworst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities\nhave minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for\nvalue alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural\nto suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the\nfirst study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and\nrandomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of\nthe candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or\nvoters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for\nminimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We\nempirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems\nusing collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing\nlanguage model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our\ninstance-optimal algorithms."}

Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class\nchallenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;\nothers to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which\ncandidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived\npost-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered\ntools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate\nstrategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;\neffort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on\nmerit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and\nderive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional\nselectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and\nutility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that\nquantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities\nwithout compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a\nperception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across\ngroups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,\npropagating disparities backward through otherwise \"fair\" selection processes.\nWhile the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle\nlinking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and\nstructural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments\nshape individual incentives in meritocratic systems."}
