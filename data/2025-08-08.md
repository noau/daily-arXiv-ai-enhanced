### [1] [Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825)
*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Voost是一个统一的框架，通过联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，利用扩散变换器增强衣物与人体关系的推理能力，无需任务特定网络或额外标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟试穿技术在姿势和外观变化下准确建模衣物与人体对应关系仍具有挑战性，因此提出了Voost框架来解决这一问题。

Method: Voost采用扩散变换器联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，支持生成方向和衣物类别的灵活条件，并引入注意力温度缩放和自我校正采样技术。

Result: Voost在试穿和试脱基准测试中达到了最先进的水平，在对齐精度、视觉逼真度和泛化能力上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Voost通过联合建模和推理技术，显著提升了虚拟试穿和试脱任务的性能，为衣物与人体关系推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅技术在处理大规模场景和有限计算资源时存在效率和存储的局限性，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用场景感知补偿算法优化高斯参数，提出金字塔采样表示管理高斯基元，并开发了广义高斯混合模型压缩算法以提高存储效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了内存效率和视觉质量，同时保持了实时渲染速度。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了3D高斯泼溅技术在大规模场景管理和存储效率上的问题，为复杂环境下的实时渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

### [3] [Laplacian Analysis Meets Dynamics Modelling: Gaussian Splatting for 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04966)
*Yifan Zhou,Beizhen Zhao,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的动态3D高斯泼溅框架，通过混合显式-隐式函数解决了现有动态3D高斯泼溅方法在运动细节保留和变形一致性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D高斯泼溅方法在建模动态场景时存在过度平滑或特征碰撞的问题，主要是由于在不同频率下保持运动细节和变形一致性的频谱冲突。

Method: 提出了三种关键创新：频谱感知的拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动态属性以及基于KDTree的自适应高斯分割策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中表现优异，达到了更高的重建保真度。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态场景建模提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提高了重建质量和运动细节的保留能力。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding
using Gaussian Splatting.

### [5] [RAP: Real-time Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05115)
*Fangyu Du,Taiqing Li,Ziwei Zhang,Qian Qiao,Tan Yu,Dingcheng Zhen,Xu Jia,Yang Yang,Shunshun Yin,Siyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RAP是一个实时音频驱动的肖像动画框架，通过混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练推理范式，实现了高质量的说话头部视频生成，同时满足实时性能需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然在音频驱动的肖像动画中实现了高质量结果，但计算复杂性使其无法满足实时部署的需求。RAP旨在通过压缩的潜在表示和优化的设计，实现高质量的实时动画生成。

Method: RAP引入了混合注意力机制以实现精细的音频控制，并采用静态-动态训练推理范式，避免显式运动监督，从而在压缩空间中保持高保真度。

Result: 经过大量实验验证，RAP在实时约束下实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高质量的音频-视觉同步和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RAP通过创新的混合注意力机制和训练范式，成功地解决了实时音频驱动肖像动画的挑战，为高质量实时动画生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

### [6] [Refining Gaussian Splatting: A Volumetric Densification Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05187)
*Mohamed Abdul Gafoor,Marius Preda,Titus Zaharia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的密度控制方法，通过利用高斯函数的惯性体积来引导3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中的细化过程，显著提升了新视图合成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3DGS密度控制策略存在局限性，无法有效管理点基元。本文旨在通过优化密度控制方法，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于高斯函数惯性体积的密度控制方法，同时研究了传统运动结构恢复（SfM）和深度图像匹配（DIM）在点云初始化中的应用。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在重建质量上超越了3DGS，并在多样场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过引入惯性体积引导的密度控制方法，本文显著提升了3DGS的性能，为新视图合成提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

### [7] [GASP: A Gradient-Aware Shortest Path Algorithm for Boundary-Confined Visualization of 2-Manifold Reeb Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05524)
*Sefat Rahman,Tushar M. Athawale,Paul Rosen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GASP的算法，用于生成符合边界、紧凑且与函数梯度对齐的Reeb图可视化，改进了现有算法，并通过定性和定量评估验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Reeb图绘制算法忽略了或违反了边界约束、紧凑性和与函数梯度对齐这三个关键属性，导致可视化结果不能忠实反映数据的拓扑结构。

Method: 本文提出了GASP算法，该算法在设计时考虑了边界约束、紧凑性和与函数梯度的对齐，从而生成更忠实于原始数据的Reeb图可视化。

Result: 通过与Topology ToolKit (TTK)中的几何重心算法进行对比，定性和定量评估表明，GASP算法生成的Reeb图在表达数据拓扑结构方面表现更优。

Conclusion: GASP算法通过优化Reeb图的可视化属性，显著提升了可视化结果的代表性和准确性，为后续研究提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.

### [8] [Point cloud segmentation for 3D Clothed Human Layering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05531)

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D点云分割范式，用于同时关联不同层次的服装层，以实现语义重建和高质量的三维服装建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 三维服装建模和模拟在时尚、娱乐和动画等领域至关重要，但由于服装与身体的高变异性，生成逼真的皱纹等细节具有挑战性。现有的3D扫描数据缺乏语义信息，当前的3D形状分割方法主要用于场景理解，而非建模。

Method: 提出了一种新的3D点云分割范式，称为“clothed human layering”，允许每个3D点同时关联到不同层次。创建了一个合成数据集，并评估了不同神经网络设置以实现粗粒度和细粒度的服装层识别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实扫描数据集上的服装领域分割效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的分割范式为三维服装建模提供了更准确的语义重建，尤其在处理重叠服装层时表现优越。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

*Chris Careaga,Yağız Aksoy*

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的图像重光照方法，结合传统渲染的物理精确性和神经渲染的逼真外观，实现完全可控的3D光照编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D计算机图形工具（如Blender）对光照的物理控制在真实场景中难以实现，因此需要一种结合物理精确性和神经渲染的方法，以实现对野外图像的高质量重光照。

Method: 通过单目几何和内在组件的估计推断场景的彩色网格表示，结合路径追踪引擎和神经渲染器，并使用自监督学习在原始图像集上训练神经渲染器。

Result: 该方法能够提供物理精确且逼真的光照效果，适用于野外场景的重光照任务。

Conclusion: 该方法将传统3D图形工具的光照控制能力扩展到野外图像重光照领域，为相关应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

### [10] [Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829)
*Devora Chait-Roth,Kedar S. Namjoshi,Thomas Wies*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个保证混合模式更新的算法，利用服务操作的语义属性（如可交换性）确保一致性，并证明了语义感知的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线服务通常采用可扩展的微服务架构，但服务功能的动态更新可能导致不一致性问题。现有方法要么牺牲效率，要么存在风险，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于服务操作语义属性（如可交换性）的算法框架，并开发了相关理论以推导新算法并验证其正确性。

Result: 通过理论证明，论文展示了语义感知是避免混合模式不一致性的必要条件，并提出的算法能够确保客户端的操作原子性。

Conclusion: 论文的理论和算法为混合模式更新提供了可靠的解决方案，确保了服务动态更新时的数据一致性。

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

### [11] [Online EFX Allocations with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04779)
*Themistoklis Melissourgos,Nicos Protopapas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个在线公平分配问题，通过引入预测模型来优化分配策略，最终目标是实现近似EFX（无嫉妒到任意物品）分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线公平分配问题，探索如何在物品动态到达且需即时分配的情况下，确保分配结果满足EFX。由于一般条件下近似EFX难以实现，因此引入预测机制以优化分配效果。

Method: 采用预测向量估计代理的真实估值，并结合真实值进行分配决策。特别针对加法估值函数类，研究了不同算法（仅依赖预测、忽略预测或两者结合）的可行性。

Result: 证明了在忽略预测或仅依赖预测的情况下，近似EFX分配不可行。提出了一种针对两个代理且具有相同估值的算法，其近似EFX的效果随预测准确性的提高而提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在相同估值的简单情况下，预测准确性对实现近似EFX至关重要。提出的算法为实际应用中的公平分配提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good
arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be
immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to
ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.
Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in
general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting
algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine
learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we
measure their error using the total variation distance from the true
valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with
the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility
results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore
predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both
the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the
prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate
EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary
to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the
necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.
The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy
of the predictions increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex
systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across
edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more
from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be
balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs),
users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in
terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these
heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with
multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a
fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we
propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee
energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a
social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and
numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and
energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive
services.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的三人版桥牌游戏，旨在消除固定搭档，使游戏更动态灵活。通过实时重新定义团队组成，增加了游戏的不可预测性，迫使玩家不断更新策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的桥牌游戏中，固定搭档可能会导致游戏策略的僵化和不公平。本文旨在通过设计一种新的三人版桥牌游戏，增加动态性和公平性。

Method: 采用实时重新定义团队组成的方法，引入新的评分系统以减少偏见，并通过奖励系统促进战术决策和风险评估。游戏保留了常规桥牌规则，但要求玩家在没有固定搭档的情况下协作。

Result: 模拟结果显示，这种新游戏设计能够有效促进多样化策略的应用，并展示了动态团队组成对玩家战术调整的积极影响。

Conclusion: 这种三人版桥牌游戏设计不仅提高了游戏的动态性和公平性，还为锦标赛卡牌游戏的推广提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This article presents a new three-player version of the bridge playing card
game for the purpose of ending fixed partnerships so that the play can be more
dynamic and flexible. By dynamically redefining team makeup in real time, this
game design increases unpredictability and forces players to repeatedly update
strategy. A novel scoring system is introduced to reduce biases present in
conventional rule-based games by favoring fairness via reward systems that
enforce tactical decision making and risk assessment. Being subject to regular
bridge rules, this version tests players to collaborate without fixed
friendships, requiring fluid adjustment and adaptive bidding behavior in real
time. Strategic issues involve aggressive and defensive bidding, adaptable
playing styles, and loss-seeking strategies specific to the three-player
structure. The article discusses probabilistic issues of bidding, trump and
no-trump declarative effects, and algorithmic methods to trick-taking.
Simulation outcomes illustrate the efficiency of diverse strategies. The game's
architecture is ideal for competitions and possibly influential in broadening
entry pools for tournament card games.
