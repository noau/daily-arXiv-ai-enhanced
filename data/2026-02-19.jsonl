Recent AI progress now makes full automation feasible for various CAD tasks. However, progress is bottlenecked by data: public corpora mostly contain sketch-extrude sequences, lack complex operations, multi-operation composition and design intent, and thus hinder effective fine-tuning. Attempts to bypass this with frozen VLMs often yield simple or invalid programs due to limited 3D grounding in current foundation models. We present CADEvolve, an evolution-based pipeline and dataset that starts from simple primitives and, via VLM-guided edits and validations, incrementally grows CAD programs toward industrial-grade complexity. The result is 8k complex parts expressed as executable CadQuery parametric generators. After multi-stage post-processing and augmentation, we obtain a unified dataset of 1.3m scripts paired with rendered geometry and exercising the full CadQuery operation set. A VLM fine-tuned on CADEvolve achieves state-of-the-art results on the Image2CAD task across the DeepCAD, Fusion 360, and MCB benchmarks."}

Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors."}

It trivially embeds the $λ$-calculus, although the entire semantics builds on only naive set theory; as a consequence, all constructs including inheritance are inherently commutative, idempotent, and associative; the linearization problem of multiple inheritance simply does not arise. This induces a fully abstract semantics of the lazy $λ$-calculus with respect to Böhm tree equivalence. Overlay-Calculus is distilled from the Overlay language, a practical implementation in which we observed further emergent phenomena: the Expression Problem dissolves, programs are CPS-agnostic, records natively encode random-access memory, and self-reference resolves to multiple targets. These properties suggest applications to configuration languages, dependency injection, object-oriented programming, composable effect systems, modular software architectures, file-system-as-compiler, general-purpose programming, and no-code development."}

Accepted to Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2026 (FC 2026)", "summary": "In this paper, we explore the short- and long-term stability of backed stablecoins offering constant mint and redeem prices to all agents. We refer to such designs as price window-based, since the mint and redeem prices constrain the stablecoin's market equilibrium. We show that, without secondary stabilization mechanisms, price window designs cannot achieve both short- and long-term stability unless they are backed by already-stable reserves. In particular, the mechanism faces a tradeoff: either risk eventual reserve depletion through persistent arbitrage by a speculator, or widen the distance between mint and redeem prices enough to disincentivize arbitrage. In the latter case, however, the market price of the stablecoin inherits the volatility of its backing asset, with fluctuations that can be proportional to the backing asset's own volatility."}

Existing work uses external equality saturation libraries, or custom implementations that are deeply tied to the specific application. However, these works only apply equality saturation at a single level of abstraction, or discard the discovered equalities when code is transformed by other compiler passes. We propose an alternative approach that represents an e-graph natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We build on a Python-based MLIR framework, xDSL, and introduce a new MLIR dialect, eqsat, that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. We show that this representation expands the scope of equality saturation in the compiler, allowing us to interleave pattern rewriting with other compiler transformations. The eqsat dialect provides a unified abstraction for compilers to utilize equality saturation across various levels of intermediate representations concurrently within the same MLIR flow."}

Combining formal analysis with numerical simulations we identify phenomena that lead to slow convergence. One of the key such phenomena is convergence to stable strategy profiles in parts of the network neighboring sets of nodes which remain inactive until the dynamics is close to converging and then switch to activity, initiating convergence to profiles with a new set of active agents and possibly leading to another iteration of such behavior. We identify structural properties of graphs which make such phenomena more likely. These properties go beyond the spectrum of a graph, which we demonstrate analyzing convergence rates on co-spectral mates."}

Previous impossibility results relied on game degeneracy, leaving open the case for generic, nondegenerate games. We resolve this by proving that while Nash-convergent dynamics theoretically exist for all nondegenerate games, computing them is likely intractable. We formulate the Impossibility Conjecture: if a locally efficient Nash-convergent dynamic exists for nondegenerate games, then $P=PPAD$. We validate this for three specific families of dynamics, showing their tractability would imply collapses such as $NP=RP$ or $CLS=PPAD$. En route, we settle the complexity of finding Nash equilibria of a given game that lie on a given affine subspace. Finally, we explain why the general conjecture remains open: we introduce a Proving Game to demonstrate that black-box reductions cannot distinguish between convergent and non-convergent dynamics in polynomial time. Our results suggest the barrier to Nash learning is not the non-existence of a vector field, but the intractability of computing it."}

We extend this to a \\emph{multi-agent combinatorial bandit} framework (\\textsc{MA-CMAB}), where actions are partitions under full-bandit feedback with non-communicating agents.

We propose a multi-agent model linking card payment outages to trust dynamics, channel avoidance, and threshold-gated withdrawals. Customers and merchants interact through repeated payment attempts, while customers additionally influence one another on a Watts-Strogatz small-world network. Customers update bounded memory variables capturing accumulated negative experience (scar) and perceived systemic risk (rumor), with merchants contributing persistent broadcast signals that may lag operational recovery. We prove that, under mild conditions on memory persistence and threshold gating, aggregate withdrawal pressure can peak strictly after the outage nadir, including during the recovery phase. Simulations reproduce behavioral hysteresis and confirm delayed peaks of outflows. We further study payment substitution via instant transfer: substitution consistently reduces peak avoidance, yet its effect on cumulative outflows is non-monotonic under realistic merchant broadcast persistence. Robustness experiments across random seeds show stable qualitative behavior. The model highlights why \"status green\" is not equivalent to risk resolution and motivates incident response strategies that address perception, merchant messaging, and post-recovery communication in addition to technical remediation."}

Unlike one-off panels, which represent the population in a single snapshot, permanent assemblies enable shifting participation across multiple rounds. This structure offers a powerful framework for ensuring that different groups of individuals are represented over time across successive panels. In particular, it allows smaller groups of individuals that may not warrant representation in every individual panel to be represented across a sequence of them. We formalize this temporal sortition framework by requiring proportional representation both within each individual panel and across the sequence of panels.\n  Building on the work of Ebadian and Micha (2025), we consider a setting in which the population lies in a metric space, and the goal is to achieve both proportional representation, ensuring that every group of citizens receives adequate representation, and individual fairness, ensuring that each individual has an equal probability of being selected. We extend the notion of representation to a temporal setting by requiring that every initial segment of the panel sequence, viewed as a cumulative whole, proportionally reflects the structure of the population. We present algorithms that provide varying guarantees of proportional representation, both within individual panels and across any sequence of panels, while also maintaining individual fairness over time."}

However, in many practical scenarios, arbitrary restrictions induced by exogenous stochasticity might be placed on a player's action set. To model this setting, for a game $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathrm{orig}}$ with action set $A_i$ for each player $i$, we introduce the corresponding Game with Stochastic Action Sets (GSAS) which is parametrized by a probability distribution over the players' set of possible action subsets $\\mathcal{S}_i \\subseteq 2^{\\vert A_i\\vert}\\backslash\\{\\varnothing\\}$. In a GSAS, players' strategies and Nash equilibria (NE) admit prohibitively large representations, thus existing algorithms for NE computation scale poorly. Under the assumption that action availabilities are independent between players, we show that NE in two-player zero-sum (2p0s) GSAS can be compactly represented by a vector of size $\\vert A_i\\vert$, overcoming naive exponential sized representation of equilibria. Computationally, we introduce an efficient approach based on sleeping internal regret minimization and show that it converges to approximate NE in 2p0s-GSAS at a rate $O(\\sqrt{\\log\\vert A_i\\vert/T})$ with appropriate choice of stepsizes, avoiding the exponential blow-up of game-dependent constants."}

A central solution concept in this setting is popularity: a matching is popular if it is a (weak) Condorcet winner, meaning that no other matching is preferred by a strict majority of agents. It is well known, however, that Condorcet winners need not exist. We therefore turn to a natural and prominent relaxation. A set of matchings is a Condorcet-winning set if, for every competing matching, a majority of agents prefers their favorite matching in the set over the competitor. The Condorcet dimension is the smallest cardinality of a Condorcet-winning set.\n  Our main results reveal a connection between Condorcet-winning sets and Pareto optimality. We show that any Pareto-optimal set of two matchings is, in particular, a Condorcet-winning set. This implication continues to hold when we impose matroid constraints on the set of matched objects, and even when agents' valuations are given as partial orders. The existence picture, however, changes sharply with partial orders. While for weak orders a Pareto-optimal set of two matchings always exists, this is -- surprisingly -- not the case under partial orders. Consequently, although the Condorcet dimension for matchings is 2 under weak orders (even under matroid constraints), this guarantee fails for partial orders: we prove that the Condorcet dimension is $Θ(\\sqrt{n})$, and rises further to $Θ(n)$ when matroid constraints are added. On the computational side, we show that, under partial orders, deciding whether there exists a Condorcet -- winning set of a given fixed size is NP-hard. The same holds for deciding the existence of a Pareto-optimal matching, which we believe to be of independent interest. Finally, we also show that the Condorcet dimension for a related problem on arborescences is also 2."}
