TL;DR: DLA框架通过结合多视角生成、3D高斯提升和姿态感知UV空间映射，从单张图像重建可动画的3D人体化身，实现了高保真效果和实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人体化身重建方法在动画保真度和细节保留方面存在不足。DLA旨在解决这一问题，结合生成模型和结构化表示，提升动画质量。

Method: DLA利用视频扩散模型生成多视角图像，提取3D高斯点云，并通过基于Transformer的编码器将其映射到参数化人体模型的UV空间，实现结构化表示。

Result: DLA在ActorsHQ和4D-Dress数据集上表现优异，在感知质量和光度精度上均超越现有方法，支持实时渲染和直观编辑。

Conclusion: DLA框架成功填补了非结构化3D表示与高保真动画化化身之间的技术鸿沟，为3D重建领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs
animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging
multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of
3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a
video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These
views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we
propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships
and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned
with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into
UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and
rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV
manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine
visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without
requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric
accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with
a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between
unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars.

### [3] [RightTyper: Effective and Efficient Type Annotation for Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16051)
*Juan Altmayer Pizzorno,Emery D. Berger*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: RightTyper是一种新型的Python类型注释工具，通过动态采样和统计过滤生成精确的类型注释，同时将类型检查转化为异常检测，显著减少运行时开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Python类型注释方法在动态特性处理、运行时开销和代码正确性假设方面存在不足，导致实际代码中大部分未注释类型。

Method: RightTyper基于程序行为生成精确类型注释，利用采样、自分析和统计过滤技术，高效且准确地推断类型。

Result: RightTyper显著提高了类型检查的召回率，同时仅产生30%的性能开销，并能够检测潜在的程序异常。

Conclusion: RightTyper通过创新的动态方法解决了现有类型注释工具的局限性，同时提升了类型检查的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the
language. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and
tedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely
untyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a
number of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer
overly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare
or user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,
degrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,
and even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all
prior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.
This assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that
have been untyped.
  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes
these disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations
based on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to
prior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing
the type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for
unintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just
30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics
by a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along
with statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type
information.

### [4] [Understanding Haskell-style Overloading via Open Data and Open Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16086)
*Andrew Marmaduke,Apoorv Ingle,J. Garrett Morris*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的统一语义System F$_\mathrm{D}$，用于Haskell风格的重载，并在Lean4中实现了其元理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决Haskell类型类系统的高级特性表达问题，提出了一种更灵活且不需要额外类型等公理的语义方法。

Method: 通过定义新的核心语言System F$_\)mathrm{D}$，实现了开放数据类型和开放函数，并通过Lean4进行了元理论机械化验证。

Result: System F$_\)mathrm{D}$能够更清晰地编码Haskell类型类系统的高级特性，且不需要额外的类型等公理。

Conclusion: System F$_\)mathrm{D}$为Haskell风格的重载提供了一种更统一且更具表达力的语义框架。

Abstract: We present a new, uniform semantics for Haskell-style overloading. We realize
our approach in a new core language, System F$_\mathrm{D}$, whose metatheory we
mechanize in the Lean4 interactive theorem prover. System F$_\mathrm{D}$ is
distinguished by its open data types and open functions, each given by a
collection of instances rather than by a single definition. We show that System
F$_\mathrm{D}$ can encode advanced features of Haskell's of type class systems,
more expressively than current semantics of these features, and without
assuming additional type equality axioms.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种图-关系数据库模型，以解决传统关系数据库与应用期望的深层嵌套数据结构之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系数据库模型与应用期望的深层嵌套数据结构之间存在不匹配问题，本文旨在提供一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 文中正式定义了图-关系数据库模型，并提供了查询的静态和动态语义。此外，还实现了EdgeQL（一种类似SQL的查询语言）和Gel系统，将EdgeQL模式和查询编译为PostgreSQL查询。

Result: 图-关系数据库模型通过EdgeQL和Gel系统，实现了高效的类对象数据操作，避免了传统ORM技术的低效性，同时接近直接编写复杂PostgreSQL查询的效率。

Conclusion: 图-关系数据库模型提供了一种灵活、组合性强且强类型的解决方案，有效解决了对象-关系不匹配问题，并在效率和功能上取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: For applications that store structured data in relational databases, there is
an impedance mismatch between the flat representations encouraged by relational
data models and the deeply nested information that applications expect to
receive. In this work, we present the graph-relational database model, which
provides a flexible, compositional, and strongly-typed solution to this
"object-relational mismatch." We formally define the graph-relational database
model and present a static and dynamic semantics for queries. In addition, we
discuss the realization of the graph-relational database model in EdgeQL, a
general-purpose SQL-style query language, and the Gel system, which compiles
EdgeQL schemas and queries into PostgreSQL queries. Gel facilitates the kind of
object-shaped data manipulation that is frequently provided inefficiently by
object-relational mapping (ORM) technologies, while achieving most of the
efficiency that comes from require writing complex PostgreSQL queries directly.

### [6] [Enhancing Compiler Optimization Efficiency through Grammatical Decompositions of Control-Flow Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16660)
*Xuran Cai*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SPL（Series-Parallel-Loop）分解的新框架，用于解决编译器优化中的复杂问题，如寄存器分配和Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的树分解算法在处理控制流图（CFGs）的稀疏性时存在不足，并且计算成本高。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 论文引入了SPL分解框架，并在图结构中为部分约束满足问题（PCSPs）提供了通用解决方案。该方法应用于三个优化问题：寄存器分配、LOSPRE优化和银行选择指令的放置优化。

Result: 实验表明，SPL分解在寄存器分配、LOSPRE优化和银行选择方面显著提升了性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPL分解被证明是解决复杂编译器优化问题的强大工具，能够高效处理寄存器分配、LOSPRE和银行选择优化等任务。

Abstract: This thesis addresses the complexities of compiler optimizations, such as
register allocation and Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy
Elimination (LOSPRE), which are often handled using tree decomposition
algorithms. However, these methods frequently overlook important sparsity
aspects of Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and result in high computational costs.
We introduce the SPL (Series-Parallel-Loop) decomposition, a novel framework
that offers optimal solutions to these challenges. A key contribution is the
formulation of a general solution for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(PCSPs) within graph structures, applied to three optimization problems. First,
SPL decomposition enhances register allocation by accurately modeling variable
interference graphs, leading to efficient register assignments and improved
performance across benchmarks. Second, it optimizes LOSPRE by effectively
identifying and eliminating redundancies in program execution. Finally, the
thesis focuses on optimizing the placement of bank selection instructions to
enhance data retrieval efficiency and reduce latency. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods,
establishing SPL decomposition as a powerful tool for complex compiler
optimizations, including register allocation, LOSPRE, and bank selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是实现更强的后验公平性保证（如EFX）以及有意义的前验公平性保证。

Method: 论文采用依赖舍入技术，利用EFX和PO分配的结构性质，并提出多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在不同估值假设下，可以通过技术手段平衡前验和后验公平性。

Abstract: Fair allocation of indivisible goods is a fundamental problem at the
interface of economics and computer science. Traditional approaches focus
either on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic
allocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these
approaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized
allocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported
on approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that
under additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is
ex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one
good (EF1).
  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness
guarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful
ex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:
  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive
valuations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed
efficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally
incompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.
We then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO
together with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and
leverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.
  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX
where some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated
pool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante
0.5-EF.
  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post
guarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of
agents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to
0.5-proportionality.
