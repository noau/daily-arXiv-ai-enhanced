TL;DR: 论文提出了WorldForge，一种无需训练的推理时框架，通过三个紧密耦合的模块解决视频扩散模型在可控性和几何一致性方面的局限性，实现精确的运动控制和逼真内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在空间智能任务中具有潜力，但其可控性和几何一致性不足，限制了实际应用，且传统方法依赖重新训练或微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识。

Method: WorldForge框架包括三个模块：Intra-Step Recursive Refinement（递归优化网络预测）、Flow-Gated Latent Fusion（利用光流分离运动与外观）、Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance（自适应纠正轨迹漂移），无需训练即可注入精确的轨迹对齐指导。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在真实性、轨迹一致性和视觉保真度上的优越性，实现了准确的运动控制和逼真的内容生成。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种新的即插即用范式，为可控视频合成提供了新视角，展示了生成先验在空间智能中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: DeliverC是一款结合GenAI和GPT-4-mini的游戏，用于编程教育中复杂主题（如C指针）的自适应实时支持。初步研究表明，它能提升学生的信心和反思能力，但也需改进AI反馈的清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有游戏化学习工具在编程教育中缺乏对复杂主题（如C指针）的自适应实时支持。

Method: 研究者开发了DeliverC，结合GenAI和GPT-4-mini，提供个性化提示和动态生成的指针相关挑战。通过25名本科生的试点研究，结合游戏数据和问卷调查，评估了系统的影响。

Result: 结果显示，学生信心和反思能力提升，错误率随关卡进展下降，但任务难度增加时参与度下降，部分学生反馈AI生成的提示不清晰。

Conclusion: DeliverC在提升系统编程的参与度和理解力方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化AI生成的反馈质量。研究展现了GenAI与游戏化学习结合的潜力。

Abstract: While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools
offer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We
present DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide
personalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a
pilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of
the system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered
constructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback
quality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective
after using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through
scaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and
some students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings
suggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems
programming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our
study highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to
support personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging
programming domains.

### [3] [Refinement-Types Driven Development: A study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15005)
*Facundo Domínguez,Arnaud Spiwack*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文倡导在普通编程中更广泛地应用SMT求解器，挑战其仅用于形式化方法和验证的传统观点，展示了如何通过精炼类型如Liquid Haskell增强程序组合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战SMT求解器仅限于形式化应用的传统观点，探索其在普通编程中简化任务、提升体验的潜力。

Method: 通过将SMT求解器无缝集成到编译器的静态检查中，特别是利用精炼类型如Liquid Haskell，提升类型检查能力。并针对编译器中的绑定作用域处理进行案例研究。

Result: 展示了SMT求解器和精炼类型如何显著增强普通编程能力，并通过Liquid Haskell的有限映射理论原型实现支持这一目标。

Conclusion: 提出借助精炼类型和SMT求解器可以简化并优化普通编程的未来愿景，同时展示了一个支持案例研究的原型实现。

Abstract: This paper advocates for the broader application of SMT solvers in everyday
programming, challenging the conventional wisdom that these tools are solely
for formal methods and verification. We claim that SMT solvers, when seamlessly
integrated into a compiler's static checks, significantly enhance the
capabilities of ordinary type checkers in program composition. Specifically, we
argue that refinement types, as embodied by Liquid Haskell, enable the use of
SMT solvers in mundane programming tasks. Through a case study on handling
binder scopes in compilers, we envision a future where ordinary programming is
made simpler and more enjoyable with the aid of refinement types and SMT
solvers. As a secondary contribution, we present a prototype implementation of
a theory of finite maps for Liquid Haskell's solver, developed to support our
case study.

Conclusion: 研究表明多维观点形成的均衡问题在复杂依赖和非二次惩罚下仍具有一致的“混乱价格”界限，验证了模型的鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Understanding the formation of opinions on interconnected topics within
social networks is of significant importance. It offers insights into
collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural
Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a
weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging
process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual
minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to
an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds
on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at
equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala
(STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and
provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.
  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented
as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a
multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant
interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy
for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the
multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex
interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we
provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties.
Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that
the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity,
involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external
disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.

### [5] [Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466)
*Tejas Pagare,Agniv Bandyopadhyay,Sandeep Juneja*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究在不确定偏好下的匹配市场中纯探索问题，目标是找到置信参数为δ且样本复杂度最小的稳定匹配。代理通过随机奖励学习偏好，适用于快速匹配但观测有噪声的平台如Upwork。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决劳动力市场平台（如Upwork）中快速匹配问题，尽管存在噪声观测和无先验知识，但仍需稳定的匹配以避免不满意。

Method: 提出一种计算高效的算法，并证明其在单侧学习中渐近匹配下界；扩展算法至双侧学习，并通过实验验证其接近样本复杂度的下界。

Result: 算法在单侧学习中渐近匹配信息论下界；扩展到双侧学习后实验结果显示其接近样本复杂度下界。

Conclusion: 通过ODE系统描述算法的理想流体路径，证明了算法的有效性，并在实验中验证了其性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain
preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence
parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via
stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use
in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be
matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable
manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable
matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity
for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true
preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We
propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically
($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning.
Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the
two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it
closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system
of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.
