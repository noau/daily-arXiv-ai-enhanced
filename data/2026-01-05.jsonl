We model each episode as a sparse linear regression problem, where the realised payoff \\(Y_t\\) is a noisy linear combination of a small number of coalition contributions. This yields a probabilistic CSG framework in which the planner first estimates a sparse value function from \\(T\\) episodes, then runs a CSG solver on the inferred coalition set. We analyse two estimation schemes. The first, Bayesian Greedy Coalition Pursuit (BGCP), is a greedy procedure that mimics orthogonal matching pursuit. Under a coherence condition and a minimum signal assumption, BGCP recovers the true set of profitable coalitions with high probability once \\(T \\gtrsim K \\log m\\), and hence yields welfare-optimal structures. The second scheme uses an \\(\\ell_1\\)-penalised estimator; under a restricted eigenvalue condition, we derive \\(\\ell_1\\) and prediction error bounds and translate them into welfare gap guarantees. We compare both methods to probabilistic baselines and identify regimes where sparse probabilistic CSG is superior, as well as dense regimes where classical least-squares approaches are competitive."}

In this article, we present a differentiable volume rendering solution called DiffTetVR for tetrahedral meshes. Unlike previous works based on regular grids, this enables the optimization of vertex positions and the local subdivision of the mesh without relying on multigrid methods. We present an efficient implementation of the forward rendering process, deduce the derivatives for the backwards pass and regularization terms for avoiding degenerate tetrahedra, and finally show how the tetrahedral mesh can be subdivided locally to enable a coarse-to-fine optimization process.

Prior work has investigated them in two separate paradigms. Chen et al. [ICML 2019] study centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is determined by its distance to a representative point (centroid) chosen in its cluster. Caragiannis et al. [NeurIPS 2024] study non-centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is determined by its maximum distance to any other data point in its cluster.\n  We generalize both paradigms to introduce semi-centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is a combination of its centroid and non-centroid losses, and study two proportional fairness criteria -- the core and, its relaxation, fully justified representation (FJR). Our main result is a novel algorithm which achieves a constant approximation to the core, in polynomial time, even when the distance metrics used for centroid and non-centroid loss measurements are different. We also derive improved results for more restricted loss functions and the weaker FJR criterion, and establish lower bounds in each case."}

In this framework, bilinear solid-shell elements are employed to model the origami panels while crease folding is considered through the angle between the director vectors of the adjacent panels. The director vector is the vector normal to the mid-surface before displacement/deformation comes in. To mitigate locking issues in the solid-shell element, we introduce the assumed natural strain method. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct origami simulations involving both straight- and curved-creases. The accuracy and efficacy of the framework are demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative analyses."}

Their goal is to democratize sophisticated -- often AI-based -- investing tools. We identify and demonstrate a fundamental profitability-fairness tradeoff in CoinAlgs that we call the CoinAlg Bind: CoinAlgs cannot ensure economic fairness without losing profit to arbitrage. We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs. We show the risks posed by a private CoinAlg: Even low-bandwidth covert-channel information leakage enables unfair value extraction."}

Despite their critical role in shaping mid-latitude weather, accurately modeling and analyzing blocking events in long meteorological records remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty visualization framework for detecting and characterizing atmospheric blocking events. First, we introduce a geometry-based detection and tracking method, evaluated on both pre-industrial climate model simulations (UKESM) and reanalysis data (ERA5), which represent historical Earth observations assimilated from satellite and station measurements onto regular numerical grids using weather models. Second, we propose a suite of uncertainty-aware summaries: contour boxplots that capture representative boundaries and their variability, frequency heatmaps that encode occurrences, and 3D temporal stacks that situate these patterns in time. Third, we demonstrate our framework in a case study of the 2003 European heatwave, mapping the spatiotemporal occurrences of blocking events using these summaries. Collectively, these uncertainty visualizations reveal where blocking events are most likely to occur and how their spatial footprints evolve over time. We envision our framework as a valuable tool for climate scientists and meteorologists: by analyzing how blocking frequency, duration, and intensity vary across regions and climate scenarios, it supports both the study of historical blocking events and the assessment of scenario-dependent climate risks associated with changes in extreme weather linked to blocking."}
