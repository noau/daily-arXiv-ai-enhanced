Yet their effectiveness depends on sustained compliance\nsupported by institutions, especially in one-off interactions. Despite advances\nin quantitative studies of cooperation and commitment, most applied analyses\nand policy debates remain largely qualitative, with limited attention to the\nallocation of scarce institutional resources between enhancing participation\nand ensuring commitment compliance. Herein, we develop an evolutionary\ngame-theoretic model that explicitly examines the strategic distribution of a\nlimited budget for institutional incentives, namely rewards or punishments,\naimed at these two critical objectives within pre-commitment frameworks. Our\nfindings reveal that a reward-based incentive approach consistently yields\ngreater coordination success than a punishment-based approach, with optimal\noutcomes arising when resources are appropriately distributed between\nparticipation promotion and compliance assurance. These findings offer novel\ninsights for designing institutional incentives to promote broad, coordinated\nadoption of new technologies."}

Project page:\n  https://ubisoft-laforge.github.io/world/chord", "summary": "Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but\ntraditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent\nmethods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from\nuser-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user\ncontrol. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR\nmaterial generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model\nsynthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the\nestimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially\npredicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as\ninput into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is\nefficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our\napproach against existing material generation and estimation methods,\ndemonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong\nrobustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore,\nwe highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications,\nincluding text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and\nmaterial editing."}
