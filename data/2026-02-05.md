  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管A*算法是游戏寻路的行业标准，但在动态3D环境中，其计算性能和视觉真实性之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用多线程框架，结合Recast网格生成、贝塞尔曲线轨迹平滑和密度分析技术，实现了标准A*算法的增强。

Result: 在十个从2D迷宫到复杂多层动态世界的增量阶段中，框架实现了1000个同时运行的代理下350+ FPS的性能，并通过密度感知路径协调实现无碰撞的群体导航。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高性能的同时，解决了动态3D环境中A*算法的权衡问题，为群体导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While the A* algorithm remains the industry standard for game pathfinding, its integration into dynamic 3D environments faces trade-offs between computational performance and visual realism. This paper proposes a multi-threaded framework that enhances standard A* through Recast-based mesh generation, Bezier-curve trajectory smoothing, and density analysis for crowd coordination. We evaluate our system across ten incremental phases, from 2D mazes to complex multi-level dynamic worlds. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework maintains 350+ FPS with 1000 simultaneous agents and achieves collision-free crowd navigation through density-aware path coordination.

Conclusion: 事件级调节是一种可推广的原则，可推动文本到运动生成超越单一动作提示的限制。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has advanced with diffusion models, yet existing systems often collapse complex multi-action prompts into a single embedding, leading to omissions, reordering, or unnatural transitions. In this work, we shift perspective by introducing a principled definition of an event as the smallest semantically self-contained action or state change in a text prompt that can be temporally aligned with a motion segment. Building on this definition, we propose Event-T2M, a diffusion-based framework that decomposes prompts into events, encodes each with a motion-aware retrieval model, and integrates them through event-based cross-attention in Conformer blocks. Existing benchmarks mix simple and multi-event prompts, making it unclear whether models that succeed on single actions generalize to multi-action cases. To address this, we construct HumanML3D-E, the first benchmark stratified by event count. Experiments on HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and HumanML3D-E show that Event-T2M matches state-of-the-art baselines on standard tests while outperforming them as event complexity increases. Human studies validate the plausibility of our event definition, the reliability of HumanML3D-E, and the superiority of Event-T2M in generating multi-event motions that preserve order and naturalness close to ground-truth. These results establish event-level conditioning as a generalizable principle for advancing text-to-motion generation beyond single-action prompts.

### [3] [Skin Tokens: A Learned Compact Representation for Unified Autoregressive Rigging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04805)
*Jia-peng Zhang,Cheng-Feng Pu,Meng-Hao Guo,Yan-Pei Cao,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SkinTokens是一种学习的紧凑离散表示方法，用于解决3D动画管线中的绑定瓶颈问题。通过FSQ-CVAE捕获蒙皮的稀疏性，将任务从连续回归转化为更易处理的序列预测问题，最终提升蒙皮效果的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动绑定方法的局限性在于蒙皮被看作是一个不适定、高维回归任务，效率低且与骨骼生成脱节。这表明需要一种新的表示方法来改进这一过程。

Method: 引入了SkinTokens，一种学习的紧凑离散表示方法，利用FSQ-CVAE捕获蒙皮的稀疏性。进一步提出了TokenRig框架，将整个绑定过程建模为骨骼参数和SkinTokens的单一序列预测问题，并通过强化学习优化几何和语义奖励。

Result: SkinTokens在蒙皮准确性上比现有方法提升了98%-133%；经过强化学习的TokenRig框架在骨骼预测上提升了17%-22%，提供了更高保真和鲁棒性的绑定解决方案。

Conclusion: SkinTokens和TokenRig提出了一种统一的生成绑定方法，解决了3D内容创作中长期存在的挑战，为提升绑定效率和质量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.

### [4] [Robustness of Stable Matchings When Attributes and Salience Determine Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04115)
*Amit Ronen,S. S. Ravi,Sarit Kraus*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了匹配市场中稳定匹配对参与者显著性向量扰动的鲁棒性，提出了多项式时间算法来验证和计算最大鲁棒半径，并设计了近似最优稳定匹配的搜索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实践中，参与者显著性向量会发生变化，因此研究稳定匹配对这些扰动的鲁棒性是一个核心问题。

Method: 通过定义鲁棒性半径，开发多项式时间算法验证和计算稳定匹配的鲁棒性，并设计近似最优稳定匹配的搜索算法。

Result: 证明了稳定匹配的稳健区域具有低维多面体结构，并可高效计算其体积。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了分析匹配市场稳健性的工具，还将问题与凸几何经典方法联系起来。

Abstract: In many matching markets--such as athlete recruitment or academic admissions--participants on one side are evaluated by attribute vectors known to the other side, which in turn applies individual \emph{salience vectors} to assign relative importance to these attributes. Since saliences are known to change in practice, a central question arises: how robust is a stable matching to such perturbations? We address several fundamental questions in this context.
  First, we formalize robustness as a radius within which a stable matching remains immune to blocking pairs under any admissible perturbation of salience vectors (which are assumed to be normalized). Given a stable matching and a radius, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to verify whether the matching is stable within the specified radius. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum robustness radius of a given stable matching. Further, we design an anytime search algorithm that uses certified lower and upper bounds to approximate the most robust stable matching, and we characterize the robustness-cost relationship through efficiently computable bounds that delineate the achievable tradeoff between robustness and cost. Finally, we show that for each stable matching, the set of salience profiles that preserve its stability factors is a product of low-dimensional polytopes within the simplex. This geometric structure precisely characterizes the polyhedral shape of each robustness region; its volume can then be computed efficiently, with approximate methods available as the dimension grows, thereby linking robustness analysis in matching markets with classical tools from convex geometry.

### [5] [Optimal Rates for Feasible Payoff Set Estimation in Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04397)
*Annalisa Barbara,Riccardo Poiani,Martino Bernasconi,Andrea Celli*

Main category: cs.GT

Abstract: We study a setting in which two players play a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, while a learner observes only their actions and has no knowledge of the equilibrium or the underlying game. A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $ε$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments.

### [6] [Graph-Based Audits for Meek Single Transferable Vote Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04527)
*Edouard Heitzmann*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图的新方法，用于审计算法选举规则（如单次可转移投票），通过考虑所有可能的选举和淘汰序列的空间，实现了对选举结果的灵活审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在选举安全的背景下，传统风险限制审计（RLA）难以适用于算法选举规则（如STV），因为这些规则依赖于选举结果的淘汰和选举顺序。因此，需要一种能够独立于时间顺序的审计框架。

Method: 研究者提出了一种基于图的方法，通过构建所有可能的选举和淘汰序列的通用空间，并在审计前固定一个子图，统计验证真实选举序列是否超出该子图。

Result: 该方法实现了对算法选举规则的灵活审计，无需依赖时间顺序，为复杂选举规则提供了一种新的审计策略。

Conclusion: 这种基于图的审计框架为解决算法选举规则的审计难题提供了有效途径，扩展了RLA的应用范围。

Abstract: In the context of election security, a Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) is a statistical framework that uses a minimal partial recount of the ballots to guarantee that the results of the election were correctly reported. A generalized RLA framework has remained elusive for algorithmic election rules such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule, because of the dependence of these rules on the chronology of eliminations and elections leading to the outcome of the election. This paper proposes a new graph-based approach to audit these algorithmic election rules, by considering the space of all possible sequences of elections and eliminations. If we fix a subgraph of this universal space ahead of the audit, a sufficient strategy is to verify statistically that the true election sequence does not leave the fixed subgraph. This makes for a flexible framework to audit these elections in a chronology-agnostic way.

Abstract: We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $α$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $α$-winning and $α$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $α$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $α$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $α$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $α< α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $α> α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $α$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $α$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $α$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $α> α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $α$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.

*Michel Grabisch,Silvia Lorenzini*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了Bel联盟博弈的核心及其他解的性质，通过引入不确定性扩展了经典联盟博弈框架，分析了在不确定环境下合同的评价和解的性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于扩展经典联盟博弈框架，引入不确定性，并探索在这种环境下合同的分割方式和解的性质，特别是当代理人拥有相同先验知识时的几何结构。

Method: 方法包括使用Dempster-Shafer理论建模代理人对世界真实状态的先验知识，利用Choquet积分表示代理人对合同的偏好，并在“事前”场景下评估合同。

Result: 研究发现，解概念之间的包含关系与经典情况相同，且在凸Bel联盟博弈中，事前核心与事前议价集重合，前提是强化议价集的定义。

Conclusion: 结论表明，尽管引入了不确定性，Bel联盟博弈的解概念仍保留了经典博弈的某些性质，尤其是在凸游戏下，核心与议价集的重合性依然成立。

Abstract: We study the properties of the core and other solution concepts of Bel coalitional games, that generalize classical coalitional games by introducing uncertainty in the framework. In this uncertain environment, we work with contracts, that specify how agents divide the values of the coalitions in the different states of the world. Every agent can have different a priori knowledge on the true state of the world, which is modeled through the Dempster-Shafer theory, while agents' preferences between contracts are modeled by the Choquet integral. We focus on the "ex-ante" scenario, when the contract is evaluated before uncertainty is resolved. We investigate the geometrical structure of the ex-ante core when agents have the same a priori knowledge which is a probability distribution. Finally, we define the (pre)nucleolus, the kernel and the bargaining set (a la Mas-Colell) in the ex-ante situation and we study their properties. It is found that the inclusion relations among these solution concepts are the same as in the classical case. Coincidence of the ex-ante core and the ex-ante bargaining set holds for convex Bel coalitional games, at the price of strengthening the definition of bargaining sets.
