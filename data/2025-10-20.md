### [1] [Fix False Transparency by Noise Guided Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15736)
*Aly El Hakie,Yiren Lu,Yu Yin,Michael Jenkins,Yehe Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)重建的不透明对象常出现虚假透明表面问题，NGS通过在训练中注入不透明噪声高斯来解决，并提出了定量评估标准和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS重建的不透明对象在交互视角下显示出虚假透明性和不一致的背景与内部图案，这是由于缺乏对表面不透明性的明确约束。

Method: NGS通过在训练过程中向对象体积中注入不透明噪声高斯，鼓励表面高斯采用更高的不透明度，仅需对现有泼溅过程进行最小修改。

Result: 实验表明，NGS显著减少了虚假透明性，同时在标准渲染指标上保持了竞争性能。

Conclusion: NGS是第一个明确识别、表征并解决3DGS中虚假透明性问题的解决方案，有效提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

### [2] [Visualizing miniKanren Search with a Fine-Grained Small-Step Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15178)
*Brysen Pfingsten,Jason Hemann*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种确定性的小型步操作语义模型，用于明确表示miniKanren执行过程中的搜索树演化，并实现了交互式可视化工具以辅助教学和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确地模拟miniKanren的执行过程，特别是搜索树的发展和目标调度行为，从而帮助用户理解其公平搜索行为和操作效果。

Method: 采用确定性小型步操作语义模型，明确表示搜索树的演化，并开发了一个交互式可视化工具，支持用户逐步执行和观察。

Result: 通过基于属性的测试验证了语义模型和工具的正确性，并通过多个示例展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该语义模型和可视化工具不仅提升了miniKanren的可理解性，还为教学和操作效果的理解提供了实用支持。

Abstract: We present a deterministic small-step operational semantics for miniKanren
that explicitly represents the evolving search tree during execution. This
semantics models interleaving and goal scheduling at fine granularity, allowing
each evaluation step-goal activation, suspension, resumption, and success -- to
be visualized precisely. Building on this model, we implement an interactive
visualizer that renders the search tree as it develops and lets users step
through execution. The tool acts as a pedagogical notional machine for
reasoning about miniKanren's fair search behavior, helping users understand
surprising answer orders and operational effects. Our semantics and tool are
validated through property-based testing and illustrated with several examples.

### [3] [Grassroots Logic Programs: A Secure, Multiagent, Concurrent, Logic Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15747)
*Ehud Shapiro*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP)，一种安全的、多代理的、并发的逻辑编程语言，用于实现分布式基层平台。GLP通过加密和安全通信渠道解决了参与者身份和代码完整性的验证问题，并证明了其安全性和区块链特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基层平台是由加密身份的人在个人设备上运行的分布式应用，但由于参与者的不可靠和恶意行为，缺乏安全的编程支持使得正确参与者无法可靠地识别彼此或验证代码完整性。

Method: GLP扩展了逻辑程序，引入了单读单写(SRSW)逻辑变量，通过加密、签名和验证的消息提供安全通信渠道，并逐步展示了其从基础逻辑程序到多代理并发系统的实现。

Result: GLP证明了安全性属性，如计算为演绎、SRSW保持、无环性和单调性，同时展示了其在区块链安全特性上的表现，并提供了安全的基层社交网络应用实例。

Conclusion: GLP为基层平台提供了一种安全、可靠的实现方法，解决了参与者身份和代码完整性的核心挑战，展现了其在分布式应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Grassroots platforms are distributed applications run by\linebreak
cryptographically-identified people on their networked personal devices, where
multiple disjoint platform instances emerge independently and coalesce when
they interoperate. Their foundation is the grassroots social graph, upon which
grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots
democratic federations can be built.
  Grassroots platforms have yet to be implemented, the key challenge being
faulty and malicious participants: without secure programming support, correct
participants cannot reliably identify each other, establish secure
communication, or verify each other's code integrity.
  We present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a secure, multiagent, concurrent,
logic programming language for implementing grassroots platforms. GLP extends
logic programs with paired single-reader/single-writer (SRSW) logic variables,
providing secure communication channels among cryptographically-identified
people through encrypted, signed and attested messages, which enable identity
and code integrity verification. We present GLP progressively: logic programs,
concurrent GLP, multiagent GLP, augmenting it with cryptographic security, and
providing smartphone implementation-ready specifications. We prove safety
properties including that GLP computations are deductions, SRSW preservation,
acyclicity, and monotonicity. We prove multiagent GLP is grassroots and that
GLP streams achieve blockchain security properties. We present a grassroots
social graph protocol establishing authenticated peer-to-peer connections and
demonstrate secure grassroots social networking applications.

### [4] [Combinatorial Contract Design: Recent Progress and Emerging Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15065)
*Michal Feldman*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了组合合同设计的新兴领域，研究了如何在代理人选择多种行动或团队合作的情境下，高效计算激励合同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用，如在线劳动市场和医疗保健，需要从算法角度解决合同设计问题，特别是在代理人行动组合指数增长或多代理人协作的复杂环境中。

Method: 文章聚焦组合合同，分析了单代理人多行动、多代理人二元行动以及多代理人多行动三种情境下的结构洞察、算法技术和复杂度障碍。

Result: 研究展示了可处理案例（如总替代奖励函数）、硬度结果以及在值和需求预言机访问下的近似保证。

Conclusion: 文章总结了组合合同设计的现状，提出了未来的开放问题和研究方向。

Abstract: Contract theory studies how a principal can incentivize agents to exert
costly, unobservable effort through performance-based payments. While classical
economic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern
applications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation
and blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is
no longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such
contracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to
\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic
mechanism design two decades ago.
  This article focuses on \emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier
within algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially
many combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a
team, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models
capture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals
coordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of
engineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)
a single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary
actions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,
we highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity
barriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward
functions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and
demand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging
landscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open
questions and promising directions for future work.

### [5] [Beyond Outcome-Based Imperfect-Recall: Higher-Resolution Abstractions for Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15094)
*Yanchang Fu,Qiyue Yin,Shengda Liu,Pei Xu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对德州扑克类游戏的新型信号观察有序游戏（SOOGs）模型，定义了分辨率界限，并提出了一种基于历史信息的FROI方法，显著提升了策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不完美信息博弈（IIGs）中的手牌抽象方法缺乏正式的任务模型和高效评估手段，限制了其应用和发展。

Method: 引入了SOOGs模型，定义了分辨率界限，并通过PAOI分析了传统方法的局限性，提出了整合历史信息的FROI方法。

Result: 实验证明FROI在德州扑克类基准测试中显著优于传统的基于结果的不完美记忆基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究为手牌抽象提供了统一的理论框架和实际设计指导，能够在IIGs中实现更高分辨率的抽象。

Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs)
such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task
model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We
introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored
to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action
sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction.
Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic
upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using
the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms
suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we
formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and
prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this
limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates
historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.
Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently
outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a
unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for
designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.

### [6] [How to Sell High-Dimensional Data Optimally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15214)
*Andrew Li,R. Ravi,Karan Singh,Zihong Yi,Weizhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.GT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机源于如何销售大型专有数据的问题，卖方希望通过提供补充信息来优化买方的决策效用。

Method: 提出了一种算法，仅需对状态空间采样即可生成近似最优的实验菜单，并分析了高维高斯数据的特殊情况。

Result: 结果表明，在高斯数据下，最优菜单可通过半定规划高效找到，且完全盈余提取的条件是买方偏好集合的自然可分离性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，高维数据下可通过高效算法实现近似最优的信息定价策略。

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an
information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a
decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the
underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various
actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through
better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the
seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To
contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the
buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a
data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of
statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time
polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is
naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm
which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a
near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We
then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)
it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of
such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)
full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition
holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.

### [7] [HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238)
*Qi Li,Wendong Huang,Qichen Ye,Wutong Xu,Cheems Wang,Rongquan Bai,Wei Yuan,Guan Wang,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了电子商务广告平台在异构拍卖渠道中的最优竞价策略，提出了针对FPA渠道的高效解决方案和跨机制的边际成本对齐策略，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告商逐渐转向平台级营销解决方案，从仅竞价商业流量转向竞标整个流量以实现整体销售最大化。这对自动化竞价系统提出了关键挑战：如何在异构拍卖渠道中确定最优策略以满足多样化的广告商目标。

Method: 论文提出了两个关键贡献：一是针对FPA渠道的考虑有机流量的最优竞价解决方案；二是引入边际成本对齐（MCA）策略，确保跨异构拍卖机制的竞价效率。

Result: 通过公共数据集的大规模离线实验和在线A/B测试，验证了所提出框架的性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决异构拍卖渠道中的竞价优化问题提供了有效方法，并通过实验证明了其实际应用的优越性和一致性。

Abstract: The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic
through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was
historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)
for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a
binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher
revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory
treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,
advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to
QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to
bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For
automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining
optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse
advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target
return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes
two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal
bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic
traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost
alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across
heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed
framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and
large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

### [8] [A Renegotiable contract-theoretic incentive mechanism for Federated learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15344)
*Xavier Tan,Xiaoli Tang,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可重新谈判的合约理论激励机制（RC-TIM），用于联邦学习（FL），以解决现有激励机制在数据所有者（DOs）无法履行合约时的效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私的限制，数据消费者（DCs）难以准确评估数据所有者（DOs）的能力和贡献，因此需要一个灵活的激励机制来促进开放协作的FL市场的发展。

Method: 通过支持合约的重新谈判，RC-TIM能够适应DOs行为和预算约束的变化，从而提供动态和灵活的激励机制。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，RC-TIM显著优于四种现有方法，平均效用提升了45.76%。

Conclusion: RC-TIM通过支持合约的动态调整，提高了FL系统对不可预测变化的适应性，从而提升了整体效率和效用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence due to heightened concerns over
data privacy. Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers
(DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs).
Thus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive
mechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL
tasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive
mechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between
a DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished.
However, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the
current contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To
address this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic
Incentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to
changes in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation
of contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL
system is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment
that can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RC-TIM significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art related methods, delivering up to a 45.76%
increase in utility on average.

### [9] [Co-Investment with Dynamic Participation under Unforeseeable Opportunity Costs: A Coalitional Game Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15384)
*Amal Sakr,Andrea Araldo,Tijani Chahed,Daniel Kofman*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于联盟博弈理论的动态共同投资方案，允许基础设施提供商和服务提供商灵活参与共同投资，以应对高机会成本的情况，从而提高利润和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施部署需要大量投资，基础设施提供商可能不愿独自承担。共同投资可以分担成本和收入，但长期承诺可能限制灵活性。

Method: 基于联盟博弈理论，提出动态方案，允许参与者灵活加入、留在或退出共同投资，并调整基础设施容量和资源共享。还提出计算入场费和退出惩罚的方法。

Result: 数值分析表明，该动态方案在高机会成本情况下鼓励参与者参与并提高利润。

Conclusion: 动态共同投资方案解决了长期承诺的限制问题，为基础设施和服务提供商提供了灵活性和更高的利润空间。

Abstract: Technologies such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) depend on the availability
of infrastructure. We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor
responsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service
Providers (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn
revenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant
investment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose
co-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple
SPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a
long period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future,
players may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment
(such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a
scheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of
(i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii)
adjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We
propose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to
appropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment. We numerically
show that our dynamic scheme encourages player participation and increases
profit (in case of high opportunity cost).

### [10] [Reviving, reproducing, and revisiting Axelrod's second tournament](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15438)
*Vincent Knight,Owen Campbell,Marc Harper,T. J. Gaffney,Nikoleta E. Glynatsi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文通过重现Axelrod的第二场囚徒困境锦标赛，验证了TFT策略的成功，并评估了原始策略在更多样化环境中的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是为了验证Axelrod历史上具有影响力的结果的可重复性，并对原始策略在当代环境中的表现进行重新评估。

Method: 通过恢复和编译原始Fortran策略实现，并构建Python接口，使用Axelrod-Python库运行锦标赛，重现Axelrod的实验。

Result: 成功复现了Axelrod的主要发现：TFT策略胜出，且成功的策略往往是合作的、对背叛有反应并愿意原谅的。此外，原始锦标赛对TFT尤其有利，但在更复杂和嘈杂的环境中，一些较不知名的策略表现更好。

Conclusion: 论文不仅系统地重现了Axelrod的第二场锦标赛，还提供了对原始结果的当代评估，并为未来研究保留了易于使用的实现。

Abstract: Direct reciprocity, typically studied using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
(IPD), is central to understanding how cooperation evolves. In the 1980s,
Robert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit
for Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for
the first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted
Fortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises
questions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.
We recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran
implementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python
interface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.
Using the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce
Axelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be
cooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings
remain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally
submitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of
the largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was
especially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the
original submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that
several lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and
under noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of
Axelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original
results in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,
easy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within
Axelrod-Python to support future research.

### [11] [Active Inverse Methods in Stackelberg Games with Bounded Rationality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15582)
*Jianguo Chen,Jinlong Lei,Biqiang Mu,Yiguang Hong,Hongsheng Qi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文扩展了逆向博弈理论，提出了主动逆向博弈方法，通过领导者主动选择行动以更好地理解跟随者的成本函数，并在二次成本函数下验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆向博弈理论方法未将学习者视为游戏的主动参与者，而主动参与可以显著提升学习效果。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 基于Fisher信息的信息增益最大化方法；2) 考虑了领导者自身成本的探索与利用平衡方法，并证明了其在二次成本函数下的性质。

Result: 实验验证表明，主动逆向博弈方法能够更快地达到Stackelberg均衡，且方法的理论性质（一致性和渐进正态性）得到了证明。

Conclusion: 主动逆向博弈方法在理论分析和实验中均表现出优越性，能够更高效地实现Stackelberg均衡。

Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players
based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not
consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could
significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse
game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded
rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to
better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of
active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain
about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic
normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of
active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the
consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost
functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through
simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game
method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active
exploration.
