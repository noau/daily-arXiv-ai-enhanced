Project\n  webpage: https://upc-virvig.github.io/Environment-aware-Motion-Matching/", "summary": "Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally\nto dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often\nstruggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of\ndynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.\nWhile Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target\ntrajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains\nchallenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing\napproaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.\nFurthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a\nseparate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between\nbody pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present\nEnvironment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body\ncharacter animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,\nemphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a\npreprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a\nmotion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that\nmatches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic\nenvironment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and\ntrajectory to navigate crowded scenes."}

Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces\nexchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for\nunderstanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable\ninsole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in\ndiverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'\nmotion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in\ncontrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal\nchoice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor\nenvironments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion\nreconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we\npresent Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from\nmulti-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial\ndata-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct\nhuman motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of\nexperiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple\nones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly\ncrouching, or dancing."}

Existing methods often struggle to capture turbulent motion while\nmaintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and\ndownstream tasks. Focusing on velocity inference, our approach introduces a\nhybrid framework that strategically separates representation and supervision\nacross spatial scales. At the coarse level, we resolve sparse-view ambiguities\nvia a novel optimization strategy that aligns long-term observation with\nphysics-grounded velocity fields. By emphasizing vorticity-based physical\nconstraints, our method enhances physical fidelity and improves optimization\nstability. At the fine level, we prioritize observational fidelity to preserve\ncritical turbulent structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream\ntasks, e.g., accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer\nvisualization and re-simulation."}

We consider in\nparticular for $T$ the allocation monad, which we introduce to model and study\nresource-safety properties. We apply these results to a series of two linear\neffectful calculi for which we establish their resource-safety properties.\n  The first calculus is a linear call-by-push-value language with two\nallocation effects $\\mathit{new}$ and $\\mathit{delete}$. The resource-safety\nproperties follow from the linear (and even ordered) character of the typing\nrules.\n  We then explain how to integrate exceptions on top of linearity and effects\nby adjoining default destruction actions to types, as inspired by C++/Rust\ndestructors. We see destructors as objects $\\delta : A\\rightarrow TI$ in the\nslice category over $TI$. This construction gives rise to a second calculus, an\naffine ordered call-by-push-value language with exceptions and destructors, in\nwhich the weakening rule performs a side-effect. As in C++/Rust, a ``move''\noperation is necessary to allow random-order release of resources, as opposed\nto last-in-first-out order. Moving resources is modelled as an exchange rule\nthat performs a side-effect."}

This paper explains such \"rational stagnation\" as an equilibrium\nsustained by a rational adversary whose utility follows the principle of\npotential loss, $u_{D} = U_{ideal} - U_{actual}$. Starting from the Prisoner's\nDilemma, we show that the transformation $u_{i}' = a\\,u_{i} + b\\,u_{j}$ and the\nratio of mutual recognition $w = b/a$ generate a fragile cooperation band\n$[w_{\\min},\\,w_{\\max}]$ where both (C,C) and (D,D) are equilibria. Extending to\na dynamic model with stochastic cooperative payoffs $R_{t}$ and intervention\ncosts $(C_{c},\\,C_{m})$, a Bellman-style analysis yields three strategic\nregimes: immediate destruction, rational stagnation, and intervention\nabandonment. The appendix further generalizes the utility to a\nreference-dependent nonlinear form and proves its stability under reference\nshifts, ensuring robustness of the framework. Applications to social-media\nalgorithms and political trust illustrate how adversarial rationality can\ndeliberately preserve fragility."}
