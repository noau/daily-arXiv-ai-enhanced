TL;DR: WorldForge提出了一种免训练的推理框架，通过三个紧密耦合的模块实现了高精度运动控制和逼真视频生成，提升了视频扩散模型的空间智能任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型在空间智能任务中存在可控性和几何一致性不足的问题，导致其丰富的潜在世界先验无法有效应用于实际3D/4D任务中，且依赖重新训练或微调会带来计算成本高和预训练知识退化风险。

Method: WorldForge框架包含三个模块：Intra-Step Recursive Refinement（推理时递归优化网络预测）、Flow-Gated Latent Fusion（利用光流相似性解耦运动和外观）、Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance（自适应校正轨迹漂移）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实性、轨迹一致性和视觉保真度方面优于现有技术，实现了无需训练的高精度运动控制和逼真内容生成。

Conclusion: WorldForge为可控视频合成提供了一种新颖的即插即用范式，拓展了利用生成先验进行空间智能任务的新视角。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: DeliverC是一款结合GenAI的游戏，利用GPT-4-mini为系统编程（如C指针）提供实时自适应支持。初步研究表明，它能增强学生的自信和学习效果，但AI反馈需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育中游戏化学习虽普及，但缺乏对复杂主题（如C指针）的实时自适应支持，DeliverC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过整合GPT-4-mini，DeliverC提供个性化提示和动态生成的指针相关挑战。初步研究涉及25名本科生，分析游戏数据和问卷调查。

Result: 多数学生反馈更自信和反思能力提升，错误率随关卡难度下降，但参与度随任务难度降低，部分反馈不清。

Conclusion: DeliverC在系统编程学习中表现出潜力，但需改进AI反馈质量，GenAI与游戏化学习的结合前景广阔。

Abstract: While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools
offer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We
present DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide
personalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a
pilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of
the system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered
constructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback
quality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective
after using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through
scaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and
some students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings
suggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems
programming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our
study highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to
support personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging
programming domains.

### [3] [Refinement-Types Driven Development: A study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15005)
*Facundo Domínguez,Arnaud Spiwack*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文主张将SMT求解器更广泛地应用于日常编程中，挑战其仅用于形式化方法和验证的传统观点。通过将SMT求解器无缝集成到编译器的静态检查中，可显著提升普通类型检查器在程序组合中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SMT求解器仅适用于形式化方法和验证领域，本文旨在挑战这一观点，并探索其在日常编程中的潜在应用。

Method: 通过精炼类型（如Liquid Haskell中的实现）将SMT求解器集成到编译器的静态检查中，并通过处理编译器中的绑定作用域案例研究验证其可行性。

Result: 研究证明，SMT求解器能够显著提升普通类型检查器的能力，并使日常编程变得更简单、更愉快。此外，还开发了一个有限映射理论的原型实现以支持案例研究。

Conclusion: 本文展示了SMT求解器和精炼类型在日常编程中的潜力，为简化编程任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper advocates for the broader application of SMT solvers in everyday
programming, challenging the conventional wisdom that these tools are solely
for formal methods and verification. We claim that SMT solvers, when seamlessly
integrated into a compiler's static checks, significantly enhance the
capabilities of ordinary type checkers in program composition. Specifically, we
argue that refinement types, as embodied by Liquid Haskell, enable the use of
SMT solvers in mundane programming tasks. Through a case study on handling
binder scopes in compilers, we envision a future where ordinary programming is
made simpler and more enjoyable with the aid of refinement types and SMT
solvers. As a secondary contribution, we present a prototype implementation of
a theory of finite maps for Liquid Haskell's solver, developed to support our
case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解社交网络中多主题意见形成的机制对集体行为和决策有重要意义，现有模型的局限性促使研究者进一步探索多维模型的无政府状态价格。

Result: 研究发现，多维模型的无政府状态价格界限与标量模型一致，即使在更复杂的群体内外部惩罚机制下，界限依然保持不变。

Conclusion: 论文填补了多维意见形成模型中无政府状态价格研究的空白，证明了简单模型在复杂场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Understanding the formation of opinions on interconnected topics within
social networks is of significant importance. It offers insights into
collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural
Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a
weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging
process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual
minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to
an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds
on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at
equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala
(STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and
provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.
  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented
as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a
multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant
interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy
for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the
multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex
interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we
provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties.
Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that
the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity,
involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external
disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.

### [5] [Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466)
*Tejas Pagare,Agniv Bandyopadhyay,Sandeep Juneja*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究在不确定偏好下的匹配市场中寻找稳定匹配的问题，目标是以最小样本复杂度和高置信度δ识别稳定匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决劳动力市场平台（如Upwork）中的快速稳定匹配问题，其中代理通过随机奖励学习偏好且无先验知识。

Method: 提出一种计算高效算法，并在单侧学习和双侧学习设定下分析样本复杂度下界。利用ODE系统描述理想化流体路径。

Result: 算法在单侧学习设定下渐进匹配样本复杂度下界，实验结果显示双侧学习设定中接近下界。

Conclusion: 该算法在单侧和双侧学习设定中均表现出色，实现了快速稳定的匹配目标。

Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain
preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence
parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via
stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use
in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be
matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable
manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable
matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity
for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true
preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We
propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically
($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning.
Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the
two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it
closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system
of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.
