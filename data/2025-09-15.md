Motivation: 传统的材料创建和重建需要艺术家投入大量时间和专业知识，而现有基于视觉基础模型的方法在质量、灵活性和用户控制方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：生成阶段使用微调的扩散模型合成用户输入的纹理图像；估计阶段通过链式分解方案逐步预测SVBRDF通道。

Result: 该方法在质量和灵活性上优于现有方法，并在生成纹理和现实照片中表现出强鲁棒性，支持多种应用场景。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、高质量且用户可控，适用于文本到材料、图像到材料等多种应用。

Abstract: Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but
traditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent
methods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from
user-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user
control. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR
material generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model
synthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the
estimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially
predicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as
input into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is
efficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our
approach against existing material generation and estimation methods,
demonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong
robustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore,
we highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications,
including text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and
material editing.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何在一次性互动中通过制度支持提高承诺机制的效率，尤其是在稀缺资源分配上，增强参与和确保承诺遵守之间的平衡。

Method: 采用进化博弈论模型，明确分析在预承诺框架下有限预算如何战略性地分配给增强参与和确保承诺遵守两种目标，使用的激励方式包括奖励和惩罚。

Result: 研究结果表明，基于奖励的激励方法在协调成功率上优于基于惩罚的方法，且在资源合理分配时效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为新技术的广泛协调采用提供了制度激励设计的新见解，强调了奖励型激励的优越性和资源分配的优化重要性。

Abstract: There is a broad recognition that commitment-based mechanisms can promote
coordination and cooperative behaviours in both biological populations and
self-organised multi-agent systems by making individuals' intentions explicit
prior to engagement. Yet their effectiveness depends on sustained compliance
supported by institutions, especially in one-off interactions. Despite advances
in quantitative studies of cooperation and commitment, most applied analyses
and policy debates remain largely qualitative, with limited attention to the
allocation of scarce institutional resources between enhancing participation
and ensuring commitment compliance. Herein, we develop an evolutionary
game-theoretic model that explicitly examines the strategic distribution of a
limited budget for institutional incentives, namely rewards or punishments,
aimed at these two critical objectives within pre-commitment frameworks. Our
findings reveal that a reward-based incentive approach consistently yields
greater coordination success than a punishment-based approach, with optimal
outcomes arising when resources are appropriately distributed between
participation promotion and compliance assurance. These findings offer novel
insights for designing institutional incentives to promote broad, coordinated
adoption of new technologies.
