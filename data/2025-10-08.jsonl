EFX is a compelling fairness notion, and whether such allocations\nalways exist remains a major open question in fair division.\n  Our algorithm employs simulated annealing with the total number of EFX\nviolations as an objective function together with a single-transfer\nneighborhood structure to move through the space of allocations. It found an\nEFX allocation in all the instances tested, which included thousands of\nrandomly generated inputs, and scaled to settings with hundreds of agents\nand/or thousands of items. The algorithm's simplicity, along with its strong\nempirical performance makes it a simple benchmark for evaluating future\napproaches.\n  On the theoretical side, we provide a potential function for identical\nadditive valuations, which ensures that any strict-descent procedure under the\nsingle-transfer neighborhood ends at an EFX allocation. This represents an\nalternative proof of existence for identical valuations."}

Vazirani"], "title": "Fair Rent Division: New Budget and Rent Constraints", "comment": "25 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We study the classical rent division problem, where $n$ agents must allocate\n$n$ indivisible rooms and split a fixed total rent $R$. The goal is to compute\nan envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and\nrent to their own. This problem has been extensively studied under standard\nassumptions, where efficient algorithms for computing EF allocations are known.\n  We extend this framework by introducing two practically motivated\nconstraints: (i) lower and upper bounds on room rents, and (ii) room-specific\nbudget for agents. We develop efficient combinatorial algorithms that either\ncompute a feasible EF allocation or certify infeasibility.\n  We further design algorithms to optimize over EF allocations using natural\nfairness objectives such as maximin utility, leximin utility, and minimum\nutility spread. Our approach unifies both constraint types within a single\nalgorithmic framework, advancing the applicability of fair division methods in\nreal-world platforms such as Spliddit."}

There\nare $n$ agents and $n$ items occupying points in a shared metric space, and the\ngoal is to design a matching mechanism that outputs a low-cost matching between\nthe agents and items, using only agents' ordinal rankings of the candidates by\ndistance. A mechanism has distortion $\\alpha$ if it always outputs a matching\nwhose cost is within a factor of $\\alpha$ of the optimum, in every instance\nregardless of the metric space.\n  Typically, the cost of a matching is measured in terms of the total distance\nbetween matched agents and items, but this measure can incentivize unfair\noutcomes where a handful of agents bear the brunt of the cost. With this in\nmind, we consider how the metric distortion problem changes when the cost is\ninstead measured in terms of the maximum cost of any agent. We show that while\nthese two notions of distortion can in general differ by a factor of $n$, the\ndistortion of a variant of the state-of-the-art mechanism, RepMatch, actually\nimproves from $O(n^2)$ under the sum objective to $O(n^{1.58})$ under the max\nobjective. We also show that for any fairness objective defined by a monotone\nsymmetric norm, this algorithm guarantees distortion $O(n^2)$."}

However, generalizing this framework to multi-item settings has proven\nexceptionally challenging. Even under restrictive assumptions, closed-form\ncharacterizations of optimal mechanisms are rare and are largely confined to\nthe single-agent case \\cite{pavlov2011optimal,hart2017approximate,\ndaskalakis2018transport, GIANNAKOPOULOS2018432}, departing from the two-item\nsetting only when prior distributions are uniformly distributed\n\\cite{manelli2006bundling, daskalakis2017strong,giannakopoulos2018sjm}. In this\nwork, we build upon the bi-valued setting introduced by Yao\n\\cite{YAO_BIC_DSIC}, where each item's value has support 2 and lies in $\\{a,\nb\\}$. Yao's result provides the only known closed-form optimal mechanism for\nmultiple agents. We extend this line of work along three natural axes,\nestablishing the first closed-form optimal mechanisms in each of the following\nsettings: (i) $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ i.i.d. items (ii) $n$ non-i.i.d. agents\nand two i.i.d. items and (iii) $n$ i.i.d. agents and two non-i.i.d. items.

Under review at Journal of Industrial and\n  Management Optimization (JIMO), AIMS Press (Manuscript ID: jimo-457,\n  submitted September 2025)", "summary": "Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in\ncomplex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc\nheuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous\neconomic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart\ncontract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and\nfairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and\nuniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism\ndesign, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable\nconvergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate\nperformance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept\nreal-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee\nvolatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case\nstudy illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in\nrealistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed\nmechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while\nremaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond\nsteady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy\nrelevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource\nallocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable\ncoordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with\nempirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only\nas technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency,\naccountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation."}

We further allow\nvalue functions (games) and thus their M\\\"obius transforms (synergy function)\nand Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a\nring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve\nthis and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,\nefficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine\nShapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two\nnovel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to\ninterpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of\nhigher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of\nthe null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements\nand flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with\nvanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The\nlatter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of\nhierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply\na unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical\nproperties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the\nprojection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion\nalgebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain\npreviously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new\nperspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph\nstructured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up\nthe possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine\nlearning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many\nmore."}
