This compiler pass repairs the connectivity\nof two-qubit gates whose operands are not adjacent by inserting SWAP gates that\nmove the state of qubits between directly connected qubits. Deciding when to\nintroduce SWAPs while minimizing their count is critical because the error in\nquantum programs increases exponentially with the circuit latency, measured in\nnumber of gates along the critical path of the circuit. Prior work for this\nproblem relied on heuristics and exact methods that partition the circuit into\ntwo or more layers, but failed to exploit valuable dependence information in\nany form.\n  This paper introduces a novel qubit mapping algorithm based on the weight of\ntransitive dependences. The introduced mapper models quantum circuits with\naffine abstractions thereby yielding the ability to compute transitive\ndependences. In turn, the newfound information is used to partition circuits by\ndependence distances and compute, efficiently, distinct weights for each layer.\nWe evaluate the efficiency of our mapper on IBM and Rigetti QPUs, using the\nlarge datasets from the QUEKO and QASMBench benchmark suites, and against four\nbaseline tools (QMAP, Sabre, Cirq and TKET), demonstrating notable improvements\nin circuit depth and swap count while delivering competitive scalability."}

In such settings, scarce resources tend\nto become increasingly concentrated among more affluent individuals, while the\nneeds of the broader population remain unmet. While fully centralized\ndistribution may be logistically or politically unfeasible, issuing buying\nrights offers a more practical alternative: they can be implemented digitally,\ne.g., via tokens traded on online platforms, making them significantly easier\nto administer. We model a scenario in which a regulator periodically\ndistributes buying rights with the aim of promoting a more equitable\nallocation. Our contributions include (i) the definition of the (iterated)\nmarket where in each round the buying rights are distributed and then traded\nalongside the resource, (ii) the approximation algorithm of the market-clearing\nprices in every round, and (iii) the upper bound on \\textit{frustration} -- a\nnotion conceptually similar to the Price of Anarchy, but for systems regulated\nthrough buying rights, defined as the arising loss in fairness the individual\nbuyers have to take when the distribution is handled via the market."}

Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to\ncapture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence\nand form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit\n(drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We\nfocus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces\nthe subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium\ncan be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not\nin models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent\nadvances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in\nfinite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key\nfindings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms\nreliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information\noligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the\nresulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results\ndemonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium\nstrategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium\nanalysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study\nanswers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition\nauthorities and regulators."}
