  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨3D图形绘图中边缘交叉构型对感知和可读性的影响，以改进质量评估和绘图算法。

Method: 通过实证研究分析了3D图形绘图中边缘距离和相对方向等因素的影响。

Result: 研究发现3D绘图中的边缘交叉构型对可读性有显著影响，并与2D绘图中的交叉有所不同。

Conclusion: 3D图形绘图的感知和质量评估需要考虑额外的深度因素及其对边缘配置的影响。

Abstract: Human perception of graph drawings is influenced by a variety of impact
factors for which quality measures are used as a proxy indicator. The
investigation of those impact factors and their effects is important to
evaluate and improve quality measures and drawing algorithms. The number of
edge crossings in a 2D graph drawing has long been a main quality measure for
drawing evaluation. The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained
attraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that
they can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios. While
edge crossings can also occur in 3D, there are edge configurations in space
that are not crossings but might be perceived as such from a specific
viewpoint. Such configurations create crossings when projected on the
corresponding 2D image plane and could impact readability similar to 2D
crossings. In 3D drawings, the additional depth aspect and the subsequent
impact factors of edge distance and relative edge direction in space might
further influence the importance of those configurations for readability. We
investigate the impact of such factors in an empirical study and report on
findings of difference between major factor categories.

Conclusion: MeshLLM通过引入创新的分解和训练策略，为3D网格的文本序列化处理提供了高效解决方案，展现出广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多层3D服饰重建通常需要昂贵的多视角捕捉设备和专业的3D编辑工作，限制了逼真服装化虚拟人的创建。

Conclusion: ReMu为逼真多层服饰化虚拟人的重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

### [5] [Uncertainty Estimation for Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting from Primitive-Based Representations of Error and Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02443)
*Thomas Gottwald,Edgar Heinert,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的高斯散布不确定性估计方法，通过训练误差和可见性的原始表示来获取更有意义的像素级不确定性信息，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯散布在机器人和医学等关键应用中需要可靠的不确定性估计，现有方法通常仅估计高斯原始件的方差，未能充分捕捉不确定性信息。

Method: 通过将训练误差和可见性投影到原始件上，建立原始件的表示，并通过渲染新视图的原始件表示来获取不确定性特征图。最后通过保留数据的像素级回归聚合不确定性特征图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实误差上表现出高相关性，尤其在前景对象上优于现有方法。回归模型对新场景具有泛化能力，无需保留数据即可估计不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在高斯散布的不确定性估计中表现优异，尤其在关键应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

### [6] [Efficient compilation and execution of synchronous programs via type-state programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01199)
*Avinash Malik*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的线性时间编译技术，用于同步程序的有限状态机（FSM）编译，通过基于图的改写规则和模板元编程，显著提高了执行速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步程序在安全关键嵌入式软件中广泛应用，但其编译过程中由于状态空间爆炸问题，生成高效且紧凑的可执行文件具有挑战性。

Method: 引入了基于图的改写规则和线性时间算法，将同步程序转换为有限状态机，并通过C++模板元编程将FSM编码为类型状态程序。

Result: 实验结果表明，编译时间和生成二进制大小与现有技术相当，但执行时间平均快31-60%。

Conclusion: 提出的线性时间编译技术有效解决了同步程序编译中的挑战，显著提升了执行效率。

Abstract: Synchronous programs are used extensively in implementation of safety
critical embedded software. Imperative synchronous programming languages model
multiple Finite State Machines (FSMs) executing in lockstep at logical clock
ticks. The synchronous view of time along with the FSM based design enables
easier formal verification. The synchronous composition of multiple FSMs,
during compilation, results in the well known state space explosion problem.
Hence, efficiently compiling imperative synchronous programs into small and
fast executables is challenging. This paper introduces a novel linear time
compilation technique for automata based compilation of synchronous programs.
Graph based rewrite rules for kernel programming constructs are introduced. A
linear time algorithm applies these rules to produce a FSM. The FSM is then
encoded into a type-state program using template meta-programming in C++.
Experimental results show that the compilation time and generated binary size
is comparable, while the execution times are on average 31-60% faster than
current state-of-the-art compilers.
