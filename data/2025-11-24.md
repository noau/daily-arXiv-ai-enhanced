Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PhysMorph-GS 通过将可微分材料点方法（MPM）与3D高斯散射结合，解决了物理模拟中图像损失无法直接引导优化的“渲染间隙”问题，引入多模态渲染损失和多段优化方案，显著提升了形态变换的边界保真度和时间稳定性。

Motivation: 物理模拟的形态变换支持大变形和拓扑变化，但现有方法因非可微表面提取导致图像损失无法直接优化物理模拟。本文旨在解决这一“渲染间隙”问题。

Method: PhysMorph-GS 结合可微分材料点方法（MPM）与3D高斯散射，通过变形感知的上采样桥将稀疏粒子状态映射到密集高斯分布，并通过多模态渲染损失和多重优化方案指导物理模拟的优化。

Result: PhysMorph-GS 在复杂形态变换序列中提高了边界保真度和时间稳定性，深度监督版本相较于纯物理基线减少了约2.5%的 Chamfer 距离。

Conclusion: PhysMorph-GS 填补了物理感知渲染流水线中的关键空白，通过可微分粒子-高斯桥实现了基于图像监督的逆向设计。

Abstract: Shape morphing with physics-based simulation naturally supports large deformations and topology changes, but existing methods suffer from a "rendering gap": nondifferentiable surface extraction prevents image losses from directly guiding physics optimization. We introduce PhysMorph-GS, which couples a differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states (x, F) to dense Gaussians (mu, Sigma). Multi-modal rendering losses on silhouette and depth backpropagate along two paths, from covariances to deformation gradients via a stretch-based mapping and from Gaussian means to particle positions. Through the MPM adjoint, these gradients update deformation controls while mass is conserved at a compact set of anchor particles. A multi-pass interleaved optimization scheme repeatedly injects rendering gradients into successive physics steps, avoiding collapse to purely physics-driven solutions. On challenging morphing sequences, PhysMorph-GS improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over a differentiable MPM baseline and better reconstructs thin structures such as ears and tails. Quantitatively, our depth-supervised variant reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5 percent relative to the physics-only baseline. By providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, PhysMorph-GS closes a key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines and enables inverse design directly from image-space supervision.

### [2] [Near-Optimal Dropout-Robust Sortition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16897)
*Maya Pal Gambhir,Bailey Flanigan,Aaron Roth*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的最小化损失算法，用于解决公民小组中成员突然退出的问题，确保小组的代表性和规模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公民小组中的成员突然退出会破坏小组的大小和代表性，论文旨在解决如何在无法提前预见退出的情况下选择合适的成员

Method: 通过建模为一个极小极大博弈问题，最小化损失目标函数，并提出一种高效的梯度下降子程序算法

Result: 算法在不同情况下保持最优性，并通过真实数据集验证了其性能和稳健性

Conclusion: 该算法不仅解决了成员退出的问题，还首次量化了稳健性、损失和公平性之间的权衡

Abstract: Citizens' assemblies - small panels of citizens that convene to deliberate on policy issues - often face the issue of panelists dropping out at the last-minute. Without intervention, these dropouts compromise the size and representativeness of the panel, prompting the question: Without seeing the dropouts ahead of time, can we choose panelists such that after dropouts, the panel will be representative and appropriately-sized? We model this problem as a minimax game: the minimizer aims to choose a panel that minimizes the loss, i.e., the deviation of the ultimate panel from predefined representation targets. Then, an adversary defines a distribution over dropouts from which the realized dropouts are drawn. Our main contribution is an efficient loss-minimizing algorithm, which remains optimal as we vary the maximizer's power from worst case to average case. Our algorithm - which iteratively plays a projected gradient descent subroutine against an efficient algorithm for computing the best-response dropout distribution - also addresses a key open question in the area: how to manage dropouts while ensuring that each potential panelist is chosen with relatively equal probabilities. Using real-world datasets, we compare our algorithms to existing benchmarks, and we offer the first characterizations of tradeoffs between robustness, loss, and equality in this problem.

### [3] [The Effects of Latency on a Progressive Second-Price Auction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17424)
*Jordana Blazek,Eric Olson,Fredrick C. Harris*

Main category: cs.GT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解投标延迟、异步分析和初始投标随机性如何影响渐进第二价格拍卖机制中的ε-纳什均衡，以及如何通过设置适当的保留价来稳定卖方收益并保持效率。

Method: 论文引入了一种算法来找到最小收益均衡状态，并通过设置略低于清算价格的保留价来稳定卖方收益，同时保持系统的效率。

Result: 尽管部分买方在个体分配的效用和成本上存在不可预测性，但其总体效用是可预测的。设置适当的保留价有效稳定了卖方收益。

Conclusion: 结论表明，在弹性需求的假设下，通过设置略低于清算价格的保留价，可以稳定卖方收益并保持效率，同时确保买方的总效用是可预测的。

Abstract: The progressive second-price auction of Lazar and Semret is a decentralized mechanism for the allocation and real-time pricing of a divisible resource. Our focus is on how delays in the receipt of bid messages, asynchronous analysis by buyers of the market and randomness in the initial bids affect the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria obtained by the method of truthful $\varepsilon$-best reply. We introduce an algorithm for finding minimal-revenue equilibrium states and then show that setting a reserve price just below clearing stabilizes seller revenue while maintaining efficiency. Utility is of primary interest given the assumption of elastic demand. Although some buyers experienced unpredictability in the value and cost of their individual allocations, their respective utilities were predictable.
