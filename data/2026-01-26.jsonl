Ferguson", "Chinmay Maheshwari", "Manxi Wu", "Shankar Sastry"], "title": "Game-to-Real Gap: Quantifying the Effect of Model Misspecification in Network Games", "comment": null, "summary": "Game-theoretic models and solution concepts provide rigorous tools for predicting collective behavior in multi-agent systems. In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation. Finally, through illustrative numerical experiments, we show that existing centrality measures in network games may provide a counterintuitive understanding of the impact of model misspecification."}

While anonymous pricing can be $Θ(\\log k)$ worse than optimal in general multi-unit environments, we show that this pessimism disappears in large markets, where no single buyer accounts for a non-negligible share of optimal revenue. Under (quasi-)regularity, anonymous pricing achieves a $2+O(1/\\sqrt{k})$ approximation to the optimal mechanism; the worst-case ratio is maximized at about $2.47$ when $k=1$ and converges to $2$ as $k$ grows. This indicates that the gains from third-degree price discrimination are mild in large markets."}

The goal of constructive candidate control is to ensure that a given candidate wins by either adding or deleting candidates from the election (in the destructive setting, the goal is to prevent a given candidate from winning). We show that such control problems are NP-hard to solve for many participatory budgeting voting rules, including Phragmén and Method of Equal Shares, but there are natural cases with polynomial-time algorithms (e.g., for the GreedyAV rule and projects with costs encoded in unary). We also argue that control by deleting candidates is a useful tool for assessing the performance (or, strength) of initially losing projects, and we support this view with experiments."}

Ex-ante fairness (proportionality) can trivially be obtained by giving all goods to a random agent. Yet, such an allocation is very unfair ex-post. This has motivated the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) approach, seeking a randomized allocation that is ex-ante proportional and is supported only on ex-post fair allocations (e.g., on allocations that are envy-free-up-to-one-good (EF1), or give some constant fraction of the maximin share (MMS)). It is commonly pointed out that the distribution that allocates all goods to one agent at random fails to be ex-post fair as it ignores the variances of the values of the agents. We examine the approach of trying to mitigate this problem by minimizing the sum-of-variances of the values of the agents, subject to ex-ante proportionality. We study the ex-post fairness properties of the resulting distributions. In support of this approach, observe that such an optimization will indeed deterministically output a proportional allocation if such exists. We show that when valuations are identical, this approach indeed guarantees fairness ex-post: all allocations in the support are envy-free-up-to-any-good (EFX), and thus guarantee every agent at least 4/7 of her maximin share (but not her full MMS). On the negative side, we show that this approach completely fails when valuations are not identical: even in the simplest setting of only two agents and two goods, when the additive valuations are not identical, there is positive probability of allocating both goods to the same agent. Thus, the supporting ex-post allocation might not even be EF1, and might not give an agent any constant fraction of her MMS. Finally, we present similar negative results for other natural minimization objectives that are based on variances."}

We study the maximum displacement problem: with coalition size $m$, how many of the current top-$k$ winners can be forced out? We show coalition power decomposes into two independent prefix-majorization constraints, capturing how much the coalition can (i) boost outsiders and (ii) suppress weak winners. For arbitrary scoring rules these prefix inequalities are tight, efficiently checkable necessary conditions (exact in the continuous relaxation).\n  For common-step arithmetic-progression (AP) score ladders, including Borda, truncated Borda, $k$-approval/$k$-veto, plurality, and multi-level rules such as $3$--$2$--$1$, we prove a Majorization--Lattice Theorem: feasible aggregate score vectors are exactly the integer points satisfying the Block--HLP prefix-sum capacity constraints plus a single global congruence condition modulo the step size $g$. For Borda ($g=1$) the congruence vanishes, yielding a pure prefix-majorization test.\n  This characterization yields an $O(k'\\log k')$ exact feasibility oracle for displacing $k'$ winners, and an $O(k(\\log k)^2\\log(mx))$ algorithm (via dual-envelope binary search) for computing the maximum achievable displacement $k^\\ast$. Experiments on Mallows profiles and PrefLib elections confirm exact cutoffs, diminishing returns, and substantial gains over baseline heuristics; for $g>1$ they also demonstrate the predicted congruence effect, where prefix-only tests produce false positives. The oracle scales to extreme instances, processing $10^9$ candidates in under 28 seconds (memory permitting)."}

Prior research has mostly focused on maximizing the principal's utility, often resulting in highly disparate payments among agents. Such disparities among agents may be undesirable in practice, for example, in standardized public contracting or worker cooperatives where fairness concerns are essential. Motivated by these considerations, our objective is to quantify the tradeoff between maximizing the principal's utility and equalizing payments among agents, which we call the price of non-discrimination. Our first result is an almost tight bound on the price of non-discrimination, which scales logarithmically with the number of agents. This bound can be improved to a constant by allowing some relaxation of the non-discrimination requirement. We then provide a comprehensive characterization of the tradeoff between the level of non-discrimination and the loss in the optimal utility."}
