Due to the distributed and noncooperative nature of the game, some curious agents may wish to steal sensitive information from neighboring agents during parameter exchanges. Additionally, communication delays arising from network congestion, particularly in wireless settings, as well as feedback delays, can hinder the convergence of agents to a Nash equilibrium. Although a recent work addressed both communication and feedback delays in aggregative games, it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the delays are fixed over time and identical across agents. Hence, the case of time-varying and non-identical delays across agents has never been considered in aggregative games. In this work, we address the combined challenges of privacy leakage with time-varying and non-identical communication and feedback delays for the first time. We propose an online distributed dual averaging algorithm that simultaneously tackles these challenges while achieving a provably low regret bound. Our simulation result shows that the running average of each client's local action converges over time."}

At each decision point, joint action selection is resolved via matrix games whose payoffs incorporate both immediate rewards and future value estimates. To handle uncertainty arising from bandit feedback during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Simultaneous AlphaZero incorporates a regret-optimal solver for matrix games with bandit feedback. Simultaneous AlphaZero demonstrates robust strategies in a continuous-state discrete-action pursuit-evasion game and satellite custody maintenance scenarios, even when evaluated against maximally exploitative opponents."}

While supplying GenAI with detailed personal information improves representation fidelity, feasibility constraints make complete information access impractical. We bridge this gap by developing a game-theoretic framework that models strategic information revelation to GenAI in collective decision-making. The technical challenges lie in characterizing members' equilibrium behaviors under interdependent strategies and quantifying the imperfect preference learning outcomes by digital representatives. Our contribution includes closed-form equilibrium characterizations that reveal how members strategically balance team decision preference against communication costs. Our analysis yields an interesting finding: Conflicting preferences between team members drive competitive information revelation, with members revealing more information than those with aligned preferences. While digital representatives produce aggregate preference losses no smaller than direct participation, individual members may paradoxically achieve decisions more closely aligned with their preferences when using digital representatives, particularly when manual participation costs are high or when GenAI systems are sufficiently advanced."}

To do so, we construct a Douglas-Rachford-style splitting formulation, which we then solve with a semi-smooth Newton (SSN) method. We show that our algorithm enjoys local superlinear convergence. In order to augment the fast local behavior of our SSN method with global efficiency guarantees, we develop a hybrid method that combines our SSN method with the state-of-the-art first-order method for game solving, Predictive Regret Matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$). Our hybrid algorithm leverages the global progress provided by PRM$^+$, while achieving a local superlinear convergence rate once it switches to SSN near a Nash equilibrium. Numerical experiments on matrix games demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over PRM$^+$ for high-precision solutions."}

We propose a novel second-order constrained optimization framework featuring a custom augmented Lagrangian solver that avoids TOI locking by immediately incorporating all requisite contact pairs detected via CCD, enabling more efficient active-set exploration and leading to significantly fewer Newton iterations. By adaptively updating Lagrange multipliers rather than increasing penalty stiffness, our method prevents stagnation at zero TOI while maintaining a well-conditioned system. We further introduce a constraint filtering and decay mechanism to keep the active set compact and stable, along with a theoretical justification of our method's finite-step termination and first-order time integration accuracy under a cumulative TOI-based termination criterion. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of our method. With a GPU-optimized simulator design, our method achieves an up to 103x speedup over GIPC on challenging, contact-rich benchmarks - scenarios that were previously tractable only with barrier-based methods. Our code and data will be open-sourced."}

Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines."}

This paper considers specifications given in the form of compositionally defined safe nets.\n  The paper discusses a novel concept of distributed place which implements the behaviour of an individual net place. It is shown that if distributed places cover a safe Petri net, then it is possible to delete some places without changing the behaviour. Crucially, the reduction is both static and local, making it computationally feasible in practice.\n  The resulting reduction technique is then applied to an algebra of safe Petri nets (boxes) derived compositionally from process (box) expressions. Though the original derivation can yield exponentially large boxes, prior research demonstrated that if a box expression does not involve cyclic behaviours, the exponential number of places can be reduced down to polynomial (quadratic). In this paper, using distributed places, it is show that similar optimisation can also be achieved in the case of process expressions with iteration."}
