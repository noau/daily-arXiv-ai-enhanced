By employing only a few dozen degrees of freedom, this design\nspace represents geometries ranging from simple planar configurations to\ncomplex triply periodic minimal surfaces. Coupled with this representation, we\ndevelop an efficient GPU-based homogenization pipeline that evaluates the\nstructure in under 20 ms and computes the corresponding effective elastic\ntensor in near-real-time (0.5 s). The high speed of this evaluation facilitates\nan exhaustive exploration of the design space and supports an inverse-design\nscheme that tailors the shellular structure to specific macroscopic target\nproperty. Structures derived through this approach exhibit not only geometric\ndiversity but also a wide spectrum of mechanical responses, covering a broad\nrange of material properties. Moreover, they achieve up to 91.86% of\ntheoretical upper bounds, a level of performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nshellular structures with low solid volume. Finally, our prototypes, fabricated\nvia additive manufacturing, confirm the practical manufacturability of these\ndesigns, underscoring their potential for real-world engineering applications."}

Gorantla et\nal. [GMV23] showed that for every such instance, there exists a finite number\n$\\mu$ such that, if each item type appears at least $\\mu$ times, an envy-free\nallocation exists. Their proof is non-constructive and only provides explicit\nupper bounds on $\\mu$ for the cases of two groups ($d=2$) or two item types\n($t=2$).\n  In this work, we resolve one of the main open questions posed by Gorantla et\nal. [GMV23] by deriving explicit upper bounds on $\\mu$ that hold for arbitrary\nnumbers of groups and item types. We introduce a significantly simpler, yet\npowerful technique that not only yields constructive guarantees for indivisible\ngoods but also extends naturally to chores and continuous domains, leading to\nnew results in related fair division settings such as cake cutting."}

For normal-form proper equilibria, our main\nresult is that a perturbed (proper) best response can be computed efficiently\nin extensive-form games. As a byproduct, we establish\n$\\mathsf{FIXP}_a$-completeness of normal-form proper equilibria in\nextensive-form games, resolving a long-standing open problem. In stark\ncontrast, we show that computing a normal-form proper equilibrium in polytope\npotential games is both $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and $\\mathsf{coNP}$-hard.\n  We next turn to more structured classes of games, namely symmetric network\ncongestion and symmetric matroid congestion games. For both classes, we show\nthat a perfect pure-strategy equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time,\nstrengthening the existing results for pure Nash equilibria. On the other hand,\nwe establish that, for a certain class of potential games, there is an\nexponential separation in the length of the best-response path between perfect\nand Nash equilibria.\n  Finally, for mixed strategies, we prove that computing a point geometrically\nnear a perfect equilibrium requires a doubly exponentially small perturbation\neven in $3$-player potential games in normal form. On the flip side, in the\nspecial case of polymatrix potential games, we show that equilibrium\nrefinements are amenable to perturbed gradient descent dynamics, thereby\nbelonging to the complexity class $\\mathsf{CLS}$."}

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv's requirement", "summary": "The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium\nfor public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market\nequilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the\ntheoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially\nunderdeveloped.\n  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria.\nWe show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher\nmarket equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa.\nThe dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence\nbetween the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and\nprices.\n  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation\nand dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments\nfor Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze\nwelfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we\nprove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For\nconcave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves\n$(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is\ntight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including\nproportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\\^atonnement. We obtain new market\ndynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher\nmarket. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements\nutilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the\nduality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private\nchores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the \"poles\"\nissue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also\ninitiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores."}
