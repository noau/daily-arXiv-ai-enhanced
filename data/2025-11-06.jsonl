However, such games are known for\nfailing to admit exact equilibria and also the assumption of all players being\nable to solve nonconvex problems to global optimality is questionable. This\nmotivates the study of approximate equilibria. In this work, we consider an\napproximation concept that incorporates both multiplicative and additive\nrelaxations of optimality. We propose a branch-and-cut (B&C) method that\ncomputes such approximate equilibria or proves its non-existence. For this, we\nadopt the idea of intersection cuts and show the existence of such cuts under\nthe condition that the constraints are linear and each player's cost function\nis either convex in the entire strategy profile, or, concave in the entire\nstrategy profile and linear in the rivals' strategies. For the special case of\nstandard Nash equilibrium problems, we introduce an alternative type of cut and\nshow that the method terminates finitely, provided that each player has only\nfinitely many distinct best-response sets. Finally, on the basis of the B&C\nmethod, we introduce a single-tree binary-search method to compute\nbest-approximate equilibria under some simplifying assumptions. We implemented\nthese methods and present numerical results for a class of mixed-integer flow\ngames."}

This model naturally\ncaptures applications such as team formation and network partitioning, where\nvaluations are inherently non-monotonic: the marginal values may be positive,\nnegative, or zero depending on the composition of the bundle. We focus on the\nfairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and explore its\ncompatibility with several efficiency concepts such as Transfer Stability (TS)\nthat prohibits single-item transfers that benefit one agent without making the\nother worse-off. For general graphs, our results uncover a non-monotonic\nrelationship between the number of agents $n$ and the existence of allocations\nsatisfying EF1 and transfer stability (TS): such allocations always exist for\n$n=2$, may fail to exist for $n=3$, but exist again for all $n\\geq 4$. We\nfurther show that existence can be guaranteed for any $n$ by slightly weakening\nthe efficiency requirement or by restricting the graph to forests. All of our\npositive results are achieved via efficient algorithms."}

FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten\n(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating\nfull-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,\nFlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:\nstrong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail\nrecovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss\nthat assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively\ndecay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,\nquintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up\nvariant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying\nschedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a\n35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing\nscheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for\nrobust CAD reconstruction."}

We show that the inclusion of\nvisualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could\ntheoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we\nobserve that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards\naccepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or\nnot a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that\nthe inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's\njudgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply\nthat practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations\nin generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations."}
