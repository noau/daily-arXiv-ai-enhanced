This paper proposes a multi-threaded framework that enhances standard A* through Recast-based mesh generation, Bezier-curve trajectory smoothing, and density analysis for crowd coordination. We evaluate our system across ten incremental phases, from 2D mazes to complex multi-level dynamic worlds. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework maintains 350+ FPS with 1000 simultaneous agents and achieves collision-free crowd navigation through density-aware path coordination."}

Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Text-to-motion generation has advanced with diffusion models, yet existing systems often collapse complex multi-action prompts into a single embedding, leading to omissions, reordering, or unnatural transitions. In this work, we shift perspective by introducing a principled definition of an event as the smallest semantically self-contained action or state change in a text prompt that can be temporally aligned with a motion segment. Building on this definition, we propose Event-T2M, a diffusion-based framework that decomposes prompts into events, encodes each with a motion-aware retrieval model, and integrates them through event-based cross-attention in Conformer blocks. Existing benchmarks mix simple and multi-event prompts, making it unclear whether models that succeed on single actions generalize to multi-action cases. To address this, we construct HumanML3D-E, the first benchmark stratified by event count. Experiments on HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and HumanML3D-E show that Event-T2M matches state-of-the-art baselines on standard tests while outperforming them as event complexity increases. Human studies validate the plausibility of our event definition, the reliability of HumanML3D-E, and the superiority of Event-T2M in generating multi-event motions that preserve order and naturalness close to ground-truth. These results establish event-level conditioning as a generalizable principle for advancing text-to-motion generation beyond single-action prompts."}

Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation."}

Ravi", "Sarit Kraus"], "title": "Robustness of Stable Matchings When Attributes and Salience Determine Preferences", "comment": "Accepted to AAMAS 2026. This arXiv version contains the full appendix", "summary": "In many matching markets--such as athlete recruitment or academic admissions--participants on one side are evaluated by attribute vectors known to the other side, which in turn applies individual \\emph{salience vectors} to assign relative importance to these attributes. Since saliences are known to change in practice, a central question arises: how robust is a stable matching to such perturbations? We address several fundamental questions in this context.\n  First, we formalize robustness as a radius within which a stable matching remains immune to blocking pairs under any admissible perturbation of salience vectors (which are assumed to be normalized). Given a stable matching and a radius, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to verify whether the matching is stable within the specified radius. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum robustness radius of a given stable matching. Further, we design an anytime search algorithm that uses certified lower and upper bounds to approximate the most robust stable matching, and we characterize the robustness-cost relationship through efficiently computable bounds that delineate the achievable tradeoff between robustness and cost. Finally, we show that for each stable matching, the set of salience profiles that preserve its stability factors is a product of low-dimensional polytopes within the simplex. This geometric structure precisely characterizes the polyhedral shape of each robustness region; its volume can then be computed efficiently, with approximate methods available as the dimension grows, thereby linking robustness analysis in matching markets with classical tools from convex geometry."}

A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $ε$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments."}

A generalized RLA framework has remained elusive for algorithmic election rules such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule, because of the dependence of these rules on the chronology of eliminations and elections leading to the outcome of the election. This paper proposes a new graph-based approach to audit these algorithmic election rules, by considering the space of all possible sequences of elections and eliminations. If we fix a subgraph of this universal space ahead of the audit, a sufficient strategy is to verify statistically that the true election sequence does not leave the fixed subgraph. This makes for a flexible framework to audit these elections in a chronology-agnostic way."}

Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $α$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $α$-winning and $α$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.\n  We first consider $α$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, at least an $α$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \\[ α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}. \\] Specifically, an $α$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $α< α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $α> α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$.\n  We then study the stronger notion of $α$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \\in S$ such that at least an $α$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \\[ α_{\\mathrm{dom}}^\\star = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2k}. \\] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $α$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $α> α_{\\mathrm{dom}}^\\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $α$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \\geq 2$."}

In this uncertain environment, we work with contracts, that specify how agents divide the values of the coalitions in the different states of the world. Every agent can have different a priori knowledge on the true state of the world, which is modeled through the Dempster-Shafer theory, while agents' preferences between contracts are modeled by the Choquet integral. We focus on the \"ex-ante\" scenario, when the contract is evaluated before uncertainty is resolved. We investigate the geometrical structure of the ex-ante core when agents have the same a priori knowledge which is a probability distribution. Finally, we define the (pre)nucleolus, the kernel and the bargaining set (a la Mas-Colell) in the ex-ante situation and we study their properties. It is found that the inclusion relations among these solution concepts are the same as in the classical case. Coincidence of the ex-ante core and the ex-ante bargaining set holds for convex Bel coalitional games, at the price of strengthening the definition of bargaining sets."}
