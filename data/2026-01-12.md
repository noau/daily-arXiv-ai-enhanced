Abstract: We propose an analytic construction of the geometry required for free-surface fluid simulations and deformation mechanics based on partial optimal transport such as the Gallouët-Mérigot's scheme or the Power Particles method. Such methods previously relied on a discretization of the cells by leveraging a classical convex cell clipping algorithm. However, this results in a heavy computational cost and a coarse approximation of the evaluated quantities. In contrast, our algorithm efficiently computes the generalized Laguerres cells, that is, intersections between Laguerre cells and spheres. This makes it possible to more precisely compute the volume and the area of the facets as well as strongly reducing the number of operations required to obtain the geometry. Additionally, we provide a dedicated rendering framework solely based on the computed volumetric structure.

Conclusion: DexterCap和DexterHand数据集为未来手-物体交互研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Capturing fine-grained hand-object interactions is challenging due to severe self-occlusion from closely spaced fingers and the subtlety of in-hand manipulation motions. Existing optical motion capture systems rely on expensive camera setups and extensive manual post-processing, while low-cost vision-based methods often suffer from reduced accuracy and reliability under occlusion. To address these challenges, we present DexterCap, a low-cost optical capture system for dexterous in-hand manipulation. DexterCap uses dense, character-coded marker patches to achieve robust tracking under severe self-occlusion, together with an automated reconstruction pipeline that requires minimal manual effort. With DexterCap, we introduce DexterHand, a dataset of fine-grained hand-object interactions covering diverse manipulation behaviors and objects, from simple primitives to complex articulated objects such as a Rubik's Cube. We release the dataset and code to support future research on dexterous hand-object interaction.

Conclusion: 通过范畴论方法成功地形式化了CUTLASS库中的布局代数，并实现了可验证的Python实现。

Abstract: NVIDIA's CUTLASS library provides a robust and expressive set of methods for describing and manipulating multi-dimensional tensor data on the GPU. These methods are conceptually grounded in the abstract notion of a CuTe layout and a rich algebra of such layouts, including operations such as composition, logical product, and logical division. In this paper, we present a categorical framework for understanding this layout algebra by focusing on a naturally occurring class of tractable layouts. To this end, we define two categories Tuple and Nest whose morphisms give rise to layouts. We define a suite of operations on morphisms in these categories and prove their compatibility with the corresponding layout operations. Moreover, we give a complete characterization of the layouts which arise from our construction. Finally, we provide a Python implementation of our categorical constructions, along with tests that demonstrate alignment with CUTLASS behavior. This implementation can be found at our git repository https://github.com/ColfaxResearch/layout-categories.

### [4] [Bayesian Recovery for Probabilistic Coalition Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05273)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究表明，在PCSG问题中，标准的稀疏方法（如$l_1$松弛和贪心算法）无法可靠恢复最优联盟结构，而稀疏贝叶斯学习（SBL）在此情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨标准稀疏方法是否能在PCSG问题中可靠恢复最优联盟结构，特别是在联盟重叠导致高相干性的情况下。

Method: 通过设计实验，对比$l_1$松弛、贪心算法（如OMP）和SBL方法在PCSG问题中的表现，分析其一致性。

Result: 研究发现$l_1$松弛和OMP在高相干性情况下表现不佳，而SBL能有效抑制虚假信号并高概率恢复真实联盟结构。

Conclusion: SBL在PCSG问题中优于传统的凸优化和贪心算法，证明了不同稀疏方法在此问题中的显著差异。

Abstract: Probabilistic Coalition Structure Generation (PCSG) is NP-hard and can be recast as an $l_0$-type sparse recovery problem by representing coalition structures as sparse coefficient vectors over a coalition-incidence design. A natural question is whether standard sparse methods, such as $l_1$ relaxations and greedy pursuits, can reliably recover the optimal coalition structure in this setting. We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions. The concave sparsity penalty induced by SBL suppresses spurious near-duplicates and recovers the true coalition support with probability tending to one. This establishes a rigorous separation between convex, greedy, and Bayesian sparse approaches for PCSG.

### [5] [Congestion Mitigation in Vehicular Traffic Networks with Multiple Operational Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05375)
*Doris E. M. Brown,Sajal K. Das*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种信任感知控制交易策略（TACTS），用于在多模态车辆的动态路由决策中减少网络范围的拥堵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代商业地面车辆配备了多种操作模式，但这些模式依赖不同的传感基础设施和路由算法，可能导致交通环境感知和路由偏好不一致，导致自私路由行为加剧拥堵。

Method: 论文将车辆控制系统与多模态车辆的交互建模为重复单领导者、多追随者的Stackelberg博弈，并提出TACTS策略，利用基于遗憾匹配的算法自适应更新控制系统的混合策略。

Result: 理论分析表明，TACTS算法实现的网络总旅行时间接近系统最优值；实验结果表明，在多种拥堵情况下，TACTS在减少网络拥堵方面优于其他路由和分配策略。

Conclusion: TACTS策略在多模态车辆的动态路由决策中表现出色，特别是在高拥堵和高车辆流量的情况下，能够显著减少网络范围的拥堵，尤其是在高拥堵和重型车辆流量大的情况下。对比其他路由和控制分配策略，TACTS表现更优。

Abstract: Modern commercial ground vehicles are increasingly equipped with multiple operational modalities (e.g., human driving, advanced driver assistance, remote tele-operation, full autonomy). These often rely on heterogeneous sensing infrastructures and distinct routing algorithms, which can yield misaligned perceptions of the traffic environment and route preferences. While such technologies accelerate the transition toward increasingly intelligent transportation networks, their current deployment fails to avoid challenges associated with selfish routing behavior, in which drivers or automated agents prioritize individually optimal routes instead of network-wide congestion mitigation. Existing traffic flow management strategies can address leader-follower dynamics in traffic routing problems but are not designed to account for vehicles capable of dynamically switching between multiple operational modes. This paper models the interaction between a vehicle control arbitration system and a multi-modal vehicle as a repeated single-leader, multiple follower Stackelberg game with asymmetric information. To address the intractability of computing an exact solution in this setting, we propose a Trust-Aware Control Trading Strategy (TACTS) utilizing a regret matching-based algorithm to adaptively update the arbitration system's mixed strategy over sequential, dynamic routing decisions. Theoretical results provide bounds on the realized total network travel time under TACTS algorithm relative to the system-optimal total network travel time. Experimental results of simulations between the system and a vehicle in several real-world traffic networks under various different congestion levels demonstrate that TACTS consistently reduces network-wide congestion and generally outperforms alternative routing and control-allocation strategies, particularly under high congestion and heavy induced vehicle flows.

### [6] [Mean Field Analysis of Blockchain Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05417)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将区块链增长建模为部分可观测随机博弈（POSG），并使用均值场近似将其简化为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs），以分析区块链共识机制。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了理论验证，还为去中心化共识协议的优化提供了实用见解，并支持灵活的实验设计。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing blockchain consensus mechanisms by modeling blockchain growth as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) which we reduce to a set of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) through the use of the mean field approximation. This approach formalizes the decision-making process of miners in Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems and enables a principled examination of block selection strategies as well as steady state analysis of the induced Markov chain. By leveraging a mean field game formulation, we efficiently characterize the information asymmetries that arise in asynchronous blockchain networks.
  Our first main result is an exact characterization of the tradeoff between network delay and PoW efficiency--the fraction of blocks which end up in the longest chain. We demonstrate that the tradeoff observed in our model at steady state aligns closely with theoretical findings, validating our use of the mean field approximation.
  Our second main result is a rigorous equilibrium analysis of the Longest Chain Rule (LCR). We show that the LCR is a mean field equilibrium and that it is uniquely optimal in maximizing PoW efficiency under certain mild assumptions. This result provides the first formal justification for continued use of the LCR in decentralized consensus protocols, offering both theoretical validation and practical insights.
  Beyond these core results, our framework supports flexible experimentation with alternative block selection strategies, system dynamics, and reward structures. It offers a systematic and scalable substitute for expensive test-net deployments or ad hoc analysis. While our primary focus is on Nakamoto-style blockchains, the model is general enough to accommodate other architectures through modifications to the underlying MDP.

Abstract: In many multi-agent systems, agents interact repeatedly and are expected to settle into equilibrium behavior over time. Yet in practice, behavior often drifts, and detecting such deviations in real time remains an open challenge. We introduce a sequential testing framework that monitors whether observed play in repeated games is consistent with equilibrium, without assuming a fixed sample size. Our approach builds on the e-value framework for safe anytime-valid inference: by "betting" against equilibrium, we construct a test supermartingale that accumulates evidence whenever observed payoffs systematically violate equilibrium conditions. This yields a statistically sound, interpretable measure of departure from equilibrium that can be monitored online. We also leverage Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedures to increase detection power in large games while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our framework unifies the treatment of Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria, offering finite-time guarantees and a detailed analysis of detection times. Moreover, we extend our method to stochastic games, broadening its applicability beyond repeated-play settings.
