We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentralization. We analyze equilibria under two agent behaviors: myopic (short-term utility maximization) and foresighted (multi-round planning). For myopic agents, performance-centric policies risk centralization, but foresight enables stable decentralization with some volatility to the token value. We further discuss virtual stake--a hybrid of type and stake--as an alternative approach. We show that the initial virtual stake distribution critically impacts long-term outcomes, suggesting that policies must indirectly manage decentralization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u53c2\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u77ed\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6839\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u80a1\u6743\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u4e0e\u6216\u653e\u5f03\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u77ed\u89c6\u548c\u8fdc\u89c1\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u77ed\u671f\u5185\uff0c\u4ee5\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u8fdc\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3002\u865a\u62df\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653f\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u95f4\u63a5\u7ba1\u7406\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u80a1\u6743\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

In our setting, buyers arrive sequentially demanding a set of items, each with a value drawn from a known distribution. We study environments where buyers' valuations exhibit complementarities. In such settings, standard item-pricing mechanisms fail to leverage item multiplicities, while existing static bundle-pricing mechanisms rely on problem-specific arguments that do not generalize.\n  We develop a unified technique for online resource allocation with complementarities for three domains: (i) single-minded combinatorial auctions with maximum bundle size $d$, (ii) general single-minded combinatorial auctions, and (iii) a graph-based routing model in which buyers request to route a unit of flow from a source node $s$ to a target node $t$ in a capacitated graph. Our approach yields static and anonymous bundle-pricing mechanisms whose performance improves exponentially with item capacities. For the $d$-single-minded setting with minimum item capacity $B$, we obtain an $O(d^{1/B})$-competitive mechanism, recovering the known $O(d)$ bound for unit capacities ($B=1$) and achieving exponentially better guarantees as capacities grow. For general single-minded combinatorial auctions and the graph-routing model, we obtain $O(m^{1/(B+1)})$-competitive mechanisms, where $m$ is the number of items.\n  We complement these results with information-theoretic lower bounds. We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $\u03a9((m/\\ln m)^{1/(B+2)})$ in the general single-minded setting and $\u03a9((d/\\ln d)^{1/(B+1)})$ in the $d$-single-minded setting.

In this work, we develop an approach based on mixed-integer linear programming for deciding whether and when core-stable committees are guaranteed to exist. In contrast to SAT-based approaches popular in computational social choice, our method can produce proofs for a specific number of candidates independent of the number of voters. In addition to these computational gains, our program lends itself to a novel duality-based reformulation of the core stability problem, from which we obtain new existence results in special cases.

Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\\times$, 14.34$\\times$, and 9.29$\\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\\times$, 5.61$\\times$, and 11.59$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOOPRAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u6b21\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\uff0cLOOPRAG\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLOOPRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u7279\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728PolyBench\u3001TSVC\u548cLORE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLOOPRAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548cLLMs\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad811.20\u00d7\u300114.34\u00d7\u548c9.29\u00d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LOOPRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548cLLMs\u3002"}}

These challenges are amplified in safety- and mission-critical systems, which must undergo rigorous scrutiny during design and development. Key among these challenges is the difficulty of specifying requirements that use probabilistic constructs to capture the uncertainty affecting these systems. To enable formal analysis, such requirements must be expressed in precise mathematical notations such as probabilistic logics. However, expecting developers to write requirements directly in complex formalisms is unrealistic and highly error-prone. We extend the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with support for the specification of unambiguous and correct probabilistic requirements, and develop an automated approach for translating these requirements into logical formulas. We propose and develop a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic. To increase trust in our formalizations, we provide assurance that the generated formulas are well-formed and conform to the intended semantics through an automated validation framework and a formal proof.

However, when applied to line-based datasets, such as trajectories or time series, density plots alone are insufficient, as they disrupt path continuity, obscuring smooth trends and rare anomalies. We propose a bin-based illumination model that decouples structure from density to enhance flow and reveal sparse outliers while preserving the original colormap. We introduce a bin-based outlierness metric to rank trajectories. Guided by this ranking, we construct a structural normal map and apply locally-adaptive lighting in the luminance channel to highlight chosen patterns -- from dominant trends to atypical paths -- with acceptable color distortion. Our interactive method enables analysts to prioritize main trends, focus on outliers, or strike a balance between the two.

Recent work has begun to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area, yet these approaches tend to lack a reliable and structured methodology, with little reference to existing program verification theory. This paper presents NeuroInv, a neurosymbolic approach to loop invariant generation. NeuroInv comprises two key modules: (1) a neural reasoning module that leverages LLMs and Hoare logic to derive and refine candidate invariants via backward-chaining weakest precondition reasoning, and (2) a verification-guided symbolic module that iteratively repairs invariants using counterexamples from OpenJML. We evaluate NeuroInv on a comprehensive benchmark of 150 Java programs, encompassing single and multiple (sequential) loops, multiple arrays, random branching, and noisy code segments. NeuroInv achieves a $99.5\\%$ success rate, substantially outperforming the other evaluated approaches. Additionally, we introduce a hard benchmark of $10$ larger multi-loop programs (with an average of $7$ loops each); NeuroInv's performance in this setting demonstrates that it can scale to more complex verification scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroInv\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728150\u4e2aJava\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.5%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "NeuroInv\u7531\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528LLM\u548cHoare\u903b\u8f91\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u6700\u5f31\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5019\u9009\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528OpenJML\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728150\u4e2aJava\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroInv\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.5%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u572810\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u591a\u5faa\u73af\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroInv\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new \"tool cache\" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e8f\u5217\u9a7b\u7559\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e8f\u5217\u9a7b\u7559\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bcf\u79d2\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5f15\u5165\"\u5de5\u5177\u7f13\u5b58\"API\u7aef\u70b9\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u8f7b\u677e\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}
