Common techniques for semantic reasoning are often tied to the specific\nstructures of the languages and compilers that they support. In Pyrosome,\nverified compilers are fully extensible, meaning that to extend a language\n(even with a new kind of effect) simply requires defining and verifying the\ncompilation of the new feature, reusing the old correctness theorem for all\nother cases. The novel enabling idea is an inductive formulation of equivalence\npreservation that supports the addition of new rules to the source language,\ntarget language, and compiler.\n  Pyrosome defines a formal, deeply embedded notion of programming languages\nwith semantics given by dependently sorted equational theories, so all\ncompiler-correctness proofs boil down to type-checking and equational\nreasoning. We support vertical composition of any compilers expressed in our\nframework in addition to feature extension. As a case study, we present a\nmultipass compiler from System F with simple references, through CPS\ntranslation and closure conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate how we can\nbuild such a compiler incrementally by starting with a compiler for simply\ntyped lambda-calculus and adding natural numbers, the unit type, recursive\nfunctions, and a global heap, then extending judgments with a type environment\nand adding type abstraction, all while reusing the original theorems. We also\npresent a linear version of the simply typed CPS pass and compile a small\nimperative language to the simply typed target to show how Pyrosome handles\nsubstructural typing and imperative features."}

While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness\nof compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language\ncompilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their\nrespective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap,\nwe propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal\nintermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically\ngenerates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex\ninheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer\napplies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and\nTypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and\nmutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer\nsuccessfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed\nbugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2\nconfirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java\ncompiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11\nof the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes\nof cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of\nlanguage compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language\ncompilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically\nfocused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language\ncompilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and\ncontributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments."}

However,\ndomain practitioners (such as biologists) also need to be experts in statistics\nin order to select which probabilistic model is suitable for a given particular\nproblem, relying then on probabilistic inference engines such as Stan, Pyro or\nEdward to fine-tune the parameters of that particular model. Probabilistic\nProgramming would be more useful if the model selection is made automatic,\nwithout requiring statistics expertise from the end user. Automatically\nselecting the model is challenging because of the large search space of\nprobabilistic programs needed to be explored, because the fact that most of\nthat search space contains invalid programs, and because invalid programs may\nonly be detected in some executions, due to its probabilistic nature. We\npropose a type system to statically reject invalid probabilistic programs, a\ntype-directed synthesis algorithm that guarantees that generated programs are\ntype-safe by construction, and an heuristic search procedure to handle the vast\nsearch space. We collect a number of probabilistic programs from the\nliterature, and use them to compare our method with both a type-agnostic random\nsearch, and a data-guided method from the literature (DaPPer). Our results show\nthat our technique both outperforms random search and DaPPer, specially on more\ncomplex programs. This drastic performance difference in synthesis allows for\nfast sampling of programs and enables techniques that previously suffered from\nthe complexity of synthesis, such as Genetic Programming, to be applied."}

Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to\ngenerate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training\nstrategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments.

Little research has examined the\neffects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, but we could find no\nwork studying how players manage this tradeoff in practice. This paper is an\ninitial examination of this question in the game Dota 2. First, we gather the\ngame configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that\nplayers do limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which\nremoves rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual \"tearing\".\nSecond, we survey the intent of those same players with a few subjective\nquestions. Player intent matches configuration practice. While our sampling of\nDota 2 players may not be representative, our survey does reveal suggestive\ntrends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys.\nSuch surveys can help new players adapt to the game more quickly, encourage\nresearchers to investigate the relative importance of temporal and visual\ndetail, and justify design effort by developers in \"low visual\" game\nconfigurations."}
