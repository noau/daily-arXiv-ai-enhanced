While there has been work in automatic approximate convex decompositions of meshes using convex hulls, they are not practical for applications with tight performance budgets such as games due to slower collision detection and inability to manually modify the output while maintaining convexity as compared to manually placed primitives. Rather than convex decomposition with convex hulls, we devise an approach for bottom-up decomposition of an input mesh into convex primitives specifically for rigid body simulation inspired by quadric mesh simplification. This approach fits primitives to complex, real-world meshes that provide plausible simulation performance and are guaranteed to enclose the input surface. We test convex primitive decomposition on over 60 models from Sketchfab, showing the algorithm's effectiveness. On this dataset, convex primitive decomposition has lower one-way mean and median Hausdorff and Chamfer distance from the collider to the input compared to V-HACD and CoACD, with less than one-third of the complexity as measured by total bytes for each collider. On top of that, rigid-body simulation performance measured by wall-clock time is consistently improved across 24 tested models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u51f8\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9002\u5408\u521a\u6027\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51f8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u4e3a3D\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u78b0\u649e\u4f53\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u51f8\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d7\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u7b80\u5316\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u51f8\u4f53\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5305\u56f4\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u9762\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u572860\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Hausdorff\u548cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eV-HACD\u548cCoACD\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u572824\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u521a\u6027\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u78b0\u649e\u4f53\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Using a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) parameterization of the Koopman operator, our method learns the temporal evolution of deformable dynamics and predicts future states through efficient matrix evaluations instead of sequential time integration. This yields log-linear scaling in the number of time steps and allows large portions of the trajectory to be skipped while retaining accuracy. The resulting temporal efficiency is especially advantageous for optimization tasks such as control and initial-state estimation, where the objective often depends largely on the final configuration.\n  To broaden the scope of Koopman-based reduced-order models in graphics, we introduce a discretization-agnostic extension that learns shared dynamic behavior across multiple shapes and mesh resolutions. Prior DMD-based approaches have been restricted to a single shape and discretization, which limits their usefulness for tasks involving geometry variation. Our formulation generalizes across both shape and discretization, which enables fast shape optimization that was previously impractical for DMD models. This expanded capability highlights the potential of Koopman operator learning as a practical tool for efficient deformable simulation and design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DMD\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u8fd0\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Packing algorithms seek to arrange a set of charts within a fixed-size atlas with as little downscaling as possible. Many packing applications such as content creation tools, dynamic atlas generation for video games, and texture space shading require on-the-fly interactive atlas packing. Unfortunately, while many methods have been developed for generating tight high-quality packings, they are designed for offline settings and have running times two or more orders of magnitude greater than what is required for interactive performance. While real-time GPU packing methods exist, they significantly downscale packed charts compared to offline methods. We introduce a GPU packing method that targets interactive speeds, provides packing quality approaching that of offline methods, and supports flexible user control over the tradeoff between performance and quality. We observe that current real-time packing methods leave large gaps between charts and often produce asymmetric, or poorly balanced, packings. These artifacts dramatically degrade packing quality. Our Tight And Balanced method eliminates these artifacts while retaining Interactive performance. TABI generates tight packings by compacting empty space between irregularly shaped charts both horizontally and vertically, using two approximations of chart shape that support efficient parallel processing. We balance packing outputs by automatically adjusting atlas row widths and orientations to accommodate varying chart heights. We show that our method significantly reduces chart downscaling compared to existing interactive methods while remaining orders of magnitude faster than offline alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684GPU\u56fe\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5TABI\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5b9e\u65f6GPU\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6253\u5305\u540e\u56fe\u8868\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Tight And Balanced\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TABI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u9699\u538b\u7f29\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u56fe\u96c6\u884c\u5bbd\u548c\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "TABI\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56fe\u8868\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "TABI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6GPU\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6253\u5305\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

In our setting, the agents are rational players: once the team is finalized, a game is played where the principal offers contracts (performance-based payment schemes), and each agent decides whether or not to work. Working agents reward the principal, and the goal is to choose a team that maximizes the principal's utility. Our main positive result is a 1/2-competitive algorithm when agent rewards are additive, which matches the best-possible competitive ratio. Our algorithm is randomized and this is necessary, as we show that no deterministic algorithm can attain a bounded competitive ratio. Moreover, if agent rewards are allowed to exhibit combinatorial structure known as XOS, even randomized algorithms might fail. En route to our competitive algorithm, we develop the technique of balance points, which can be useful for further exploration of online contracts in the adversarial model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5408\u7ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u5177\u6709\u52a0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u76841/2\u7ade\u4e89\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5408\u7ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u654c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u59d4\u6258\u4eba\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a\u52a0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u53ef\u80fd\u76841/2\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u5177\u67091/2\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u754c\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5408\u7ea6\u5728\u654c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5177\u6709XOS\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002"}}

These assumptions are taken by the analyzer non-deterministically, resulting in a function from sets of accepted assumptions to the resulting analysis under those assumptions.

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aA-search\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u63a7\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b27\u62c9\u4fee\u6539\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u6216\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u590d\u6742\u78b0\u649e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u8017\u6563\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faA-search\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u6216\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cA-search\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BDF2\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "A-search\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Multi-agent systems, however, are complex mathematical objects, and, therefore, defining them in a precise mathematical manner is non-trivial. As a result, researchers often considered more restrictive models that are easier to model but lack expressive power or simply omit critical complexity-theoretic results in their analysis. This paper addresses this problem by carefully analyzing and contrasting complexity-theoretic results in the explicit model, a mathematically precise formulation of the models commonly used in the literature, and the circuit-based model, a novel model that addresses the problems found in the literature. The utility of the circuit-based model is demonstrated through a comprehensive analysis that considers upper and lower bounds for the realizability and verification problems, the two most important decision problems in equilibrium analysis, for both models.

While super-resolution is widely used in production, it uniformly sacrifices spatial detail and cannot exploit variations in noise, reconstruction difficulty, and perceptual importance across the image. Adaptive sampling offers a compelling alternative, but existing end-to-end approaches rely on approximations that break down in sparse regimes.\n  We introduce an end-to-end adaptive sampling and denoising pipeline explicitly designed for the sub-1-spp regime. Our method uses a stochastic formulation of sample placement that enables gradient estimation despite discrete sampling decisions, allowing stable training of a neural sampler at low sampling budgets. To better align optimization with human perception, we propose a tonemapping-aware training pipeline that integrates differentiable filmic operators and a state-of-the-art perceptual loss, preventing oversampling of regions with low visual impact.\n  In addition, we introduce a gather-based pyramidal denoising filter and a learnable generalization of albedo demodulation tailored to sparse sampling.

Traditionally, this sparsity has been modeled using graph parameters such as treewidth and pathwidth, enabling the development of faster parameterized algorithms for tasks in compiler optimization, model checking, and program analysis. However, these parameters only approximate the structural constraints of CFGs: although every structured CFG has treewidth at most~7, many graphs with treewidth at most~7 cannot arise as CFGs. As a result, existing parameterized techniques are optimized for a substantially broader class of graphs than those encountered in practice.\n  In this work, we introduce a new grammar-based decomposition framework that characterizes \\emph{exactly} the class of control-flow graphs generated by structured programs. Our decomposition is intuitive, mirrors the syntactic structure of programs, and remains fully compatible with the dynamic-programming paradigm of treewidth-based methods. Using this framework, we design improved algorithms for two classical compiler optimization problems: \\emph{Register Allocation} and \\emph{Lifetime-Optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE)}.

This contrasts with most existing work, which focuses on specific reward functions. We conduct a computational analysis of these games, starting with the threshold problem in the antagonistic zero-sum case. As in classical games, we introduce the concept of value, defined here as the set of plays a player can guarantee to improve upon, relative to their preference relation. We show that this set is recognized by an alternating parity automaton APW of polynomial size. We also establish the computational complexity of several problems related to the concepts of value and optimal strategy, taking advantage of the $\u03c9$-automatic characterization of value. Next, we shift to multiplayer games and Nash equilibria, and revisit the threshold problem in this context. Based on an APW construction again, we close complexity gaps left open in the literature, and additionally show that cooperative rational synthesis is $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete, while it becomes undecidable in the non-cooperative case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u4eba\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u73a9\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u7531\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a$\u03c9$-\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u503c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u7531\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u4eba\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u7531$\u03c9$-\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u73a9\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u503c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u503c\u53ef\u7531\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u4f5c\u7406\u6027\u7efc\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u662f$\backslash\backslashmathsf{PSPACE}$-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5219\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u503c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u5947\u5076\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u4eba\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We focus on the well-known $\u03b1$-EFX fairness criterion, according to which the envy of an agent for another agent is bounded multiplicatively by $\u03b1$, after the removal of any good from the envied agent's bundle. The vast majority of the literature has studied $\u03b1$-EFX allocations under the assumption that full knowledge of the valuation functions of the agents is available. Motivated by the established literature on the distortion in social choice, we instead consider $\u03b1$-EFX algorithms that operate under limited information on these functions. In particular, we assume that the algorithm has access to the ordinal preference rankings, and is allowed to make a small number of queries to obtain further access to the underlying values of the agents for the goods. We show (near-optimal) tradeoffs between the values of $\u03b1$ and the number of queries required to achieve those, with a particular focus on constant EFX approximations.

It is known that any deterministic rule suffers distortion of at least $3$, and that randomized rules can achieve distortion strictly less than $3$, often at the cost of reduced transparency and interpretability. In this work, we explore the trade-off between these paradigms by asking whether it is possible to break the distortion barrier of $3$ using only \"bounded\" randomness. We answer in the affirmative by presenting a voting rule that (1) achieves distortion of at most $3 - \\varepsilon$ for some absolute constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, and (2) selects a winner uniformly at random from a deterministically identified list of constant size.

Such constraints are crucial in various applications, ranging from personnel assignments to computing resource distribution. This paper focuses on the fairness criterion known as maximin shares (MMS) and its approximations. Under arbitrary lower and upper quotas, we show that a $\\left(\\frac{2n}{3n-1}\\right)$-MMS allocation of goods exists and can be computed in polynomial time, while we also present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a $\\left(\\frac{3n-1}{2n}\\right)$-MMS allocation of chores. Furthermore, we consider the generalized scenario where items are partitioned into multiple categories, each with its own lower and upper quotas. In this setting, our algorithm computes an $\\left(\\frac{n}{2n-1}\\right)$-MMS allocation of goods or a $\\left(\\frac{2n-1}{n}\\right)$-MMS allocation of chores in polynomial time.
