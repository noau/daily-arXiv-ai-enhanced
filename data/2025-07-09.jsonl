While\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like\nimages, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the\nnon-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a\nsolution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing\nmethods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their\nability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we\nintroduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework\nthat uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and\nlocal features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that\nconvert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point\nclouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the\nreconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our\narchitecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate\nglobal and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and\nfine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset\ncontaining human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy."}

However,\nachieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images\ncovering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to\ndevelop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion\nwith a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this\nrotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D\npoint estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired\nby the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS\nleverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and\nmonocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in\nindoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane\nscaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,\nfollowed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization\nstability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to\nresolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.\nTested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers\nphotorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating\nthe potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement."}

However, optimizing purely for revenue can lead to imbalanced\nsales across products, potentially causing supplier disengagement and reduced\nproduct diversity. To address these fairness concerns, we introduce a market\nshare balancing constraint that limits the disparity in expected sales between\nany two offered products to a factor of a given parameter $\\alpha$. We study\nboth static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit\n(MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller\nselects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share\nbalancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue. We show that this\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, and we characterize the structure of\nthe optimal solution: a product is included if and only if its revenue and\npreference weight exceed certain thresholds. We further extend our analysis to\nsettings with additional feasibility constraints on the assortment and\ndemonstrate that, given a $\\beta$-approximation oracle for the constrained\nproblem, we can construct a $\\beta$-approximation algorithm under the fairness\nconstraint. In the dynamic setting, each product has a finite initial\ninventory, and the seller implements a dynamic policy to maximize total\nexpected revenue while respecting both inventory limits and the market share\nbalancing constraint in expectation. We design a policy that is asymptotically\noptimal, with its approximation ratio converging to one as inventories grow\nlarge."}

Secondly, we provide practical\nalgorithms to check many properties of coalitions and games, based on minimal\nbalanced collections, in a way which is faster than linear programming-based\nmethods. In particular, we construct an algorithm to check if the core of a\ncooperative game is a stable set in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.\nThe algorithm implements a theorem according to which the core is a stable set\nif and only if a certain nested balancedness condition is valid. The second\nlevel of this condition requires generalizing the notion of balanced collection\nto balanced sets."}

These mechanisms determine how\nenergy producers are compensated: under PC, all selected producers are paid the\nmarket-clearing price (i.e., the highest accepted bid), while under PB, each\nselected producer is paid their own submitted bid. The overarching objective is\nto meet the total demand for energy at minimal cost in the presence of\nstrategic behavior. We present two key theoretical results. First, no mechanism\ncan uniformly dominate PC or PB. This means that for any mechanism\n$\\mathcal{M}$, there exists a market configuration and a mixed-strategy Nash\nequilibrium of PC (respectively for PB) that yields strictly lower total energy\ncosts than under $\\mathcal{M}$. Second, in terms of worst-case equilibrium\noutcomes, PB consistently outperforms PC: across all market instances, the\nhighest possible equilibrium price under PB is strictly lower than that under\nPC. This suggests a structural robustness of PB to strategic manipulation.\nThese theoretical insights are further supported by extensive simulations based\non no-regret learning dynamics, which consistently yield lower average market\nprices in several energy market settings."}
