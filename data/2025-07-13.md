### [1] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成式全景图像拼接方法，通过微调基于扩散的修复模型，实现了多参考图像内容与布局的无缝合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接方法在处理视差效应、光照变化或风格差异时会出现鬼影等问题，而现有生成模型无法合成大范围连贯的全景内容，因此需要改进。

Method: 本文提出了一种方法，通过微调基于扩散的修复模型，从多张参考图像中保留场景内容和布局，并基于单张参考图像生成全景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量、图像结构和场景布局一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统和现有生成模型在全景图像拼接中的局限性，实现了高质量的合成效果。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

### [2] [LangSplatV2: High-dimensional 3D Language Gaussian Splatting with 450+ FPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07136)
*Wanhua Li,Yujie Zhao,Minghan Qin,Yang Liu,Yuanhao Cai,Chuang Gan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LangSplatV2通过稀疏编码和CUDA优化实现了476.2 FPS的高维特征投射和384.6 FPS的3D开放词汇文本查询，速度比LangSplat提升了42倍和47倍，同时提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LangSplat虽能增强3D语言场的速度和精度，但因重型解码器的瓶颈，无法实现实时推断（8.2 FPS），限制了其广泛应用。LangSplatV2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LangSplatV2假设每个高斯分布为全局字典中的稀疏编码，学习3D稀疏系数场以消除重型解码器，并结合CUDA优化提出高效的稀疏系数投射方法。

Result: LangSplatV2不仅显著提升了速度（476.2 FPS和384.6 FPS），还保持了更高的查询准确率，实现了性能和效率的双重提升。

Conclusion: LangSplatV2通过稀疏编码和高效优化，显著提升了3D语言场的实时性和准确性，为复杂场景中的语言交互应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional
feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6
FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 $\times$ speedup and a 47
$\times$ boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy.
LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into
3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with
SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for
applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,
LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even
with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this
paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the
heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2
assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary,
leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely
eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we
further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA
optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while
incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or
competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster. Codes and demos
are available at our project page: https://langsplat-v2.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Modeling the dynamic behavior of deformable objects is crucial for creating
realistic digital worlds. While conventional simulations produce high-quality
motions, their computational costs are often prohibitive. Subspace simulation
techniques address this challenge by restricting deformations to a
lower-dimensional space, improving performance while maintaining visually
compelling results. However, even subspace methods struggle to meet the
stringent performance demands of portable devices such as virtual reality
headsets and mobile platforms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel subspace simulation framework powered by a neural latent-space
integrator. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to enhance
inference stability and generalization. By operating entirely within latent
space, our method eliminates the need for full-space computations, resulting in
a highly efficient method well-suited for deployment on portable devices. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging examples involving
rods, shells, and solids, showcasing its versatility and potential for
widespread adoption.

### [5] [SD-GS: Structured Deformable 3D Gaussians for Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07465)
*Wei Yao,Shuzhao Xie,Letian Li,Weixiang Zhang,Zhixin Lai,Shiqi Dai,Ke Zhang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了SD-GS，一种紧凑高效的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过可变形锚点网格和变形感知的密集化策略，显著降低存储成本和计算复杂度，同时提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的4D高斯框架虽然在动态场景重建中表现出色，但存储成本与复杂运动表达能力之间的权衡限制了其实际应用。SD-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SD-GS引入了一种可变形锚点网格作为高效场景表示，并通过变形感知的密集化策略动态调整锚点分布，以优化模型对复杂运动的表达能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，SD-GS在模型大小上平均减少60%，帧率提升100%，且在视觉质量上优于或持平现有方法。

Conclusion: SD-GS通过创新的场景表示和动态调整策略，显著提升了动态场景重建的效率和视觉质量，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

Conclusion: 论文为从业者提供了改进工作流程的指南，并展示了在捕获平台中适配先进抠图方法的有效性。

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

### [7] [RTR-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering with Radiance Transfer and Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07733)
*Yongyang Zhou,Fang-Lue Zhang,Zichen Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RTR-GS 是一个新颖的逆渲染框架，能够在处理任意反射属性的物体时实现鲁棒的渲染、分解 BRDF 和光照，并提供可信的重光照结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 在新视角合成中表现出色，但在渲染反射物体时仍面临挑战，特别是在逆渲染和重光照方面。

Method: 提出了一种混合渲染模型，结合前向渲染用于辐射传输和后向渲染用于反射，成功分离高频和低频外观，并通过基于物理的后向渲染分支进一步优化 BRDF 和光照分解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在提升新视角合成、法线估计、分解和重光照效果的同时，保持了高效的训练和推理过程。

Conclusion: RTR-GS 是一个有效的框架，能够解决反射物体渲染中的挑战，并在多任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

### [8] [Hi-d maps: An interactive visualization technique for multi-dimensional categorical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07890)
*Radi Muhammad Reza,Benjamin A Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Hi-D地图是一种新颖的多维分类数据可视化方法，通过将多维数据映射到2D多边形区域并利用多种视觉线索和交互功能，实现了高效且空间节省的可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有技术在多维数据可视化中空间效率低和效果不足的问题。

Method: 将多维数据映射到2D多边形区域，通过分层切割和多视觉线索（如方向、厚度、颜色等）展示跨维度信息，并加入交互和层次浏览功能。

Result: Hi-D地图在多维数据可视化中表现出高效性和空间节省，且通过交互功能增强了用户体验。

Conclusion: Hi-D地图为多维数据提供了一种新颖且有效的可视化方法，尽管在维度过多时可能受限于感知能力，但在一定范围内显著提升了数据清晰度。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Hi-D maps, a novel method for the visualization of
multi-dimensional categorical data. Our work addresses the scarcity of
techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective
and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D
regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel
to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension.
We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color,
countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have
added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible
exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus,
our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our
glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many
visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of
dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before
those limits are reached.

*Tobias Kappé*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文讨论了在抽象语句语义后，程序的命题等价性是可判定且实际可行的，并从(G)KAT的角度探讨了最新的研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决一般程序等价性不可判定的问题，通过抽象语义使得命题等价性可以判定并实际应用。

Method: 论文采用了Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests（(G)KAT）的视角，探讨了命题程序等价性的最新发展。

Result: 研究表明，通过抽象语义可以将程序等价性问题转化为命题等价性问题，从而实现可判定性和实际可行性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，(G)KAT为命题程序等价性提供了新的视角，并推动了这一领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合广告通过捆绑两位广告主来增强分配效率和收入，但现有机制因忽视捆绑结构未能实现最优效果，亟需改进。

Method: 本文首先识别单槽位联合广告的最优机制，随后提出BundleNet神经网络方法专门用于多槽位联合广告场景。

Result: 实验表明BundleNet机制在单槽位场景中接近理论最优，多槽位场景中达到最先进性能，显著提升收入并满足激励兼容性和个体合理性。

Conclusion: BundleNet是一种高效的联合广告优化方法，适用于单槽位和多槽位场景，显著提升平台收益。

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

### [11] [Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Assumed Bid Cost Reverse Auction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07688)
*Jowa Yangchin,Ningrinla Marchang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RA-ABC的新型反向拍卖框架，允许用户在收集数据前出价，以提高资源效率。进一步扩展为RA-ABCDR，支持动态用户加入，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动群智感知（MCS）系统在数据收集过程中存在资源浪费问题，需要一种更高效的激励和拍卖机制来优化用户、任务提供者和平台的效用。

Method: 提出了两种方法：RA-ABC（反向拍卖假设出价成本）允许用户在收集数据前出价，减少资源消耗；RA-ABCDR进一步扩展为动态招募新用户，提升系统灵活性。

Result: 模拟结果显示，RA-ABC和RA-ABCDR显著优于传统的Tullock最优奖励函数，其中RA-ABCDR用户留存率提高54.6%，拍卖成本降低22.2%。

Conclusion: RA-ABC和RA-ABCDR通过动态用户招募和优化出价机制，显著提升了系统的稳定性、公平性和成本效率，为MCS系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is the mechanism wherein people can contribute in
data collection process using their own mobile devices which have sensing
capabilities. Incentives are rewards that individuals get in exchange for data
they submit. Reverse Auction Bidding (RAB) is a framework that allows users to
place bids for selling the data they collected. Task providers can select users
to buy data from by looking at bids. Using the RAB framework, MCS system can be
optimized for better user utility, task provider utility and platform utility.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Reverse Auction with Assumed
Bid Cost (RA-ABC) which allows users to place a bid in the system before
collecting data. We opine that performing the tasks only after winning helps in
reducing resource consumption instead of performing the tasks before bidding.
User Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated with which they decide to further
participate or not by either increasing or decreasing their bids. We also
propose an extension of RA-ABC with dynamic recruitment (RA-ABCDR) in which we
allow new users to join the system at any time during bidding rounds.
Simulation results demonstrate that RA-ABC and RA-ABCDR outperform the widely
used Tullock Optimal Prize Function, with RA-ABCDR achieving up to 54.6\%
higher user retention and reducing auction cost by 22.2\%, thereby ensuring
more efficient and sustainable system performance. Extensive simulations
confirm that dynamic user recruitment significantly enhances performance across
stability, fairness, and cost-efficiency metrics.

### [12] [Hybrid Advertising in the Sponsored Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07711)
*Zhen Zhang,Weian Li,Yuhan Wang,Qi Qi,Kun Huang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型广告模型“混合广告”，通过结合独立商店和赞助捆绑广告，显著提升了平台收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告模型和联合广告模型各自吸引不同的用户群体，导致点击率低，需要一种更通用的广告模型来提升效果。

Method: 提出混合广告模型，并引入混合遗憾网络（HRegNet）设计最优拍卖机制，确保策略激励兼容性和个体理性。

Result: 实验表明，HRegNet生成的机制比基线方法显著提高了平台收入。

Conclusion: 混合广告模型和HRegNet提供了一种高效且通用的广告解决方案。

Abstract: Online advertisements are a primary revenue source for e-commerce platforms.
Traditional advertising models are store-centric, selecting winning stores
through auction mechanisms. Recently, a new approach known as joint advertising
has emerged, which presents sponsored bundles combining one store and one brand
in ad slots. Unlike traditional models, joint advertising allows platforms to
collect payments from both brands and stores. However, each of these two
advertising models appeals to distinct user groups, leading to low
click-through rates when users encounter an undesirable advertising model. To
address this limitation and enhance generality, we propose a novel advertising
model called ''Hybrid Advertising''. In this model, each ad slot can be
allocated to either an independent store or a bundle. To find the optimal
auction mechanisms in hybrid advertising, while ensuring nearly dominant
strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality, we introduce the
Hybrid Regret Network (HRegNet), a neural network architecture designed for
this purpose. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data
demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by HRegNet significantly improve
platform revenue compared to established baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了并行链路网络中非原子拥塞游戏，通过机器学习预测优化协调机制，以最小化自私行为的影响。结果显示，准确预测可优化社会成本，即使预测不准确也能保持较低的损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索机器学习预测如何帮助设计协调机制，以在非原子拥塞游戏中平衡自私行为的负面影响。

Method: 研究方法包括利用并行链路网络中的仿射成本函数，设计协调机制并结合机器学习预测的建议，分析其对社会成本的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，准确预测可以优化社会成本（一致性），即使预测不准确也能保持较低的损失（鲁棒性）。此外，提供了一种对所有单调成本函数一致的最优机制。

Conclusion: 结论是，通过机器学习预测设计的协调机制能够在预测准确时优化社会成本，同时在不准确预测时仍保持较低的损失。研究还扩展了平滑性概念，实现了基于预测误差的平滑退化效果。

Abstract: We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine
cost functions. We investigate the power of machine-learned predictions in the
design of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of
selfishness. Our main results demonstrate that enhancing coordination
mechanisms with a simple advice on the input rate can optimize the social cost
whenever the advice is accurate (consistency), while only incurring minimal
losses even when the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate (bounded
robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent
mechanisms that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our
suggested mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness. We further
explore the notion of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism
to achieve error-tolerance, i.e. we provide an approximation guarantee that
degrades smoothly as a function of the prediction error, up to a predetermined
threshold, while achieving a bounded robustness.
