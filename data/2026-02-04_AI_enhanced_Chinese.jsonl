These visuals are important because they convey hazard information quickly, reduce reliance on lengthy text, and support decision-making in time-critical situations. However, despite their importance, disaster information graphics do not work equally well for all audiences. In practice, many graphics remain difficult to interpret, and their accessibility for vulnerable populations is still uneven and underexplored. Despite their central role, there has been little empirical work examining how graphics shape disaster communication, what challenges practitioners face in using them, and, most importantly, how inclusive current disaster graphics are in real-world settings. To address this gap, we examine how information graphics are currently produced and used in disaster communication, what issues emerge in practice, and how inclusivity is addressed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with disaster communication practitioners and researchers to examine the role of graphics across preparedness, warning, and response contexts, as well as the barriers experienced by vulnerable communities. Our findings show that graphics are widely expected and heavily relied upon, yet significant accessibility gaps persist for groups such as people with vision impairments, older adults, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Participants also highlighted that inclusive adaptations are difficult to achieve during unfolding emergencies due to operational constraints, limited guidance, and resource barriers. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for disaster management agencies and graphic designers and identify research directions for technological and adaptive support to make disaster graphics more inclusive at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u5176\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56fe\u5f62\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u8005\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53ca\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u5bb3\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u5f62\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u707e\u5bb3\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5236\u4f5c\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u56fe\u5f62\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u56fe\u5f62\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing \u03c0^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from \u03c0^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies.

Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies.

We propose Split&Splat, a framework for panoptic scene reconstruction using 3DGS. Our approach explicitly models object instances. It first propagates instance masks across views using depth, thus producing view-consistent 2D masks. Each object is then reconstructed independently and merged back into the scene while refining its boundaries. Finally, instance-level semantic descriptors are embedded in the reconstructed objects, supporting various applications, including panoptic segmentation, object retrieval, and 3D editing.

While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86 nlgcheck\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3 Neverlang \u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5355\u72ec\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 Neverlang \u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6362\u53d6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177 nlgcheck \u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "nlgcheck \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9 Neverlang \u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5982\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u72ec\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cnlgcheck \u5728 Neverlang \u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6216\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e5\u5e38\u5f00\u53d1\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "nlgcheck \u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a Neverlang \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the sustainability of such collaborative environments hinges on a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism. Focusing on coalition stability, this paper introduces a payoff allocation framework based on the least core (LC) concept. Unlike traditional methods, the LC prioritizes the cohesion of the federation by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among all potential subgroups, ensuring that no participant has an incentive to break away. To adapt this game-theoretic concept to practical, large-scale networks, we propose a streamlined implementation with a stack-based pruning algorithm, effectively balancing computational efficiency with allocation precision. Case studies in federated intrusion detection demonstrate that our mechanism correctly identifies pivotal contributors and strategic alliances. The results confirm that the practical LC framework promotes stable collaboration and fosters a sustainable FL ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u6838\u5fc3\uff08LC\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u5174\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u6838\u5fc3\uff08LC\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u6808\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7fa4\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8054\u90a6\u7684\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u548c\u6218\u7565\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5b9e\u7528LC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684FL\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u6838\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In the sequential setting, an agent can take actions one by one. After each action, the agent observes the stochastic value of the action and then decides which action to take next, if any. At the end, the agent decides what subset of taken actions to use for the principal's reward; and the principal receives the total value of this subset as a reward. Taking each action induces a certain cost for the agent. Thus, to motivate the agent to take actions the principal is expected to offer an appropriate contract. A contract describes the payment from the principal to the agent as a function of the principal's reward obtained through the agent's actions. In this work, we concentrate on studying linear contracts, i.e.\\ the contracts where the principal transfers a fraction of their total reward to the agent. We assume that the total principal's reward is calculated based on a subset of actions that forms an independent set in a given matroid. We establish a relationship between the problem of finding an optimal linear contract (or computing the corresponding principal's utility) and the so called matroid (un)reliability problem.

In the first model, we face the decision of which potential stops to open along a (e.g., bus) path, given agents' travel demands. While it is known that utilitarian optimal solutions can be identified in polynomial time, we find that computing approximately optimal solutions with respect to egalitarian welfare is NP-complete. This is surprising as we operate on the simple topology of a line graph.\n  In the second model, agents navigate a more complex network modeled by a weighted graph where edge weights represent distances. We face the decision of improving travel time along a fixed number of edges. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a dynamical program to find the optimal decision for one or two agents. By contrast, if the number of agents is variable, we find \\np-completeness and inapproximability results for utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Moreover, we demonstrate implications of our results for a related model of railway network design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u5177\u4e0a\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u7ad9\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u7b49\u798f\u5229\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8fb9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cNP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u798f\u5229\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7814\u7a76\u7ad9\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u7b49\u798f\u5229\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u798f\u5229\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u94c1\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}
