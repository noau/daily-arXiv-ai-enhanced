*Yilin Liu,Niladri Shekhar Dutt,Changjian Li,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何将多模态大型语言模型（mLLMs）应用于边界表示（B-rep）CAD对象的高级编辑任务，提出了B-repLer模型，通过细调mLLMs实现了基于文本提示的语义编辑。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管mLLMs在图像和文本任务中表现出色，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是B-rep CAD对象的编辑。这主要是因为缺乏合适的标注数据和3D表示的特殊性。论文旨在探索mLLMs是否能够适应这一高难度任务。

Method: 论文提出B-repLer模型，通过新型多模态架构处理B-rep模型，并结合现有CAD工具自动生成所需的数据集，无需外部标注。

Result: B-repLer能够理解文本提示并对给定的B-rep进行语义编辑，生成有效的输出。论文展示了多种复杂度的文本驱动B-rep编辑任务，证明了其可行性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，mLLMs可以通过适当的方法适应B-rep CAD对象的高级别编辑任务，为CAD领域带来了新的可能性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

### [2] [Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781)
*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 量子计算机优于经典计算机的潜力依赖于优化编译器的支持，本文提出了一种自动生成适用于任意量子架构的量子位映射和路由编译器的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子架构的多样性和快速演变导致量子位映射和路由（QMR）问题的复杂性增加，现有方法难以通用。

Method: 提出了一个用于描述QMR问题的抽象核心结构——设备状态机，并基于此设计了一种领域特定语言Marol，能够以简洁的方式定义QMR问题。还开发了一个强大的参数化求解器，适用于任何Marol程序。

Result: 生成的编译器在运行时和解质量上与手工编写的专用编译器竞争力相当，适用于各种量子架构，包括噪声和容错硬件平台。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了未来量子编译器的开发，适应不断涌现的新量子架构。

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

### [3] [FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129)
*Jiehua Chen,Sanjukta Roy,Sofia Simola*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了稳定匹配中三个优化问题的参数化近似性，包括Min-BP-SMI、Min-BP-SRI和Max-SMTI，分析了其计算复杂性和近似算法的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨稳定匹配问题中的优化问题，特别是在参数化框架下的近似性和计算复杂性，以解决实际应用中的匹配问题。

Method: 分析了三个问题（Min-BP-SMI、Min-BP-SRI、Max-SMTI）的NP-hard和W[1]-hard性质，并通过参数化方法研究了近似算法的可能性。

Result: Min-BP-SMI和Min-BP-SRI在参数β下难以近似到任何函数，除非FPT=W[1]。对于Max-SMTI，提出了一个基于参数“有约束的代理数量”的FPT近似方案。

Conclusion: 稳定匹配中的某些优化问题在参数化框架下具有高度的计算复杂性，但某些情况下仍可以设计有效的近似算法。

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

*Jakub Černý,Garud Iyengar,Christian Kroer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在对抗环境中为物流目的设计最优路径的游戏理论模型，通过引入随机性使路径规划更加多样化和难以预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在对抗环境中物流路径规划的挑战，传统的确定性路径规划容易被对手预测并干扰，因此需要一种更灵活、难以预测的规划方法。

Method: 论文采用了一种基于双玩家零和游戏的模型，并利用双预言机框架来计算路径规划，这种方法能够快速生成多样化的路径规划方案。

Result: 研究结果表明，该方法能够在几秒内完成计算，适用于现实场景，并且在对抗环境中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过游戏理论和双预言机框架，论文成功提出了一种在对抗环境中高效且难以预测的物流路径规划方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested
environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen
route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal
routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans
are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit
their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the
route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately
deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although
solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle
framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,
making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is
modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We
evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively
to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling
the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept
both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and
electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic
voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models.
However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a
carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the
computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even
approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more
players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from
poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or
lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose
a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial
complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial
branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative
analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show
the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of
computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.
