Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.

### [2] [Dependent Session Types for Verified Concurrent Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19129)
*Qiancheng Fu,Hongwei Xi,Ankush Das*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: TLLC扩展了TLL（两级线性依赖类型理论），加入了基于会话的并发性。其依赖会话类型结合TLL的现有依赖类型机制，支持关系验证，使得顺序程序的正确性验证可扩展到并发实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发TLLC的动机是为了结合依赖类型和会话类型的能力，以便在并发程序中验证数据的正确性和协议的可靠性。

Method: TLLC通过创新性地定义直觉会话类型，扩展了TLL的类型系统，并实现了会话类型与其他类型系统的集成。此外，研究了语言的元理论，证明了其作为项演算和过程演算的健全性。

Result: TLLC成功地将依赖会话类型应用于并发程序验证，并实现了原型编译器，可将TLLC代码转换为并发的C代码，且通过了广泛评估。

Conclusion: TLLC展示了会话类型作为一种强大工具的潜力，能够内在验证数据结构和并发算法的正确性，同时提供了通用方法将会话类型集成到其他类型系统中。

Abstract: We present TLLC which extends the Two-Level Linear dependent type theory
(TLL) with session-based concurrency. Equipped with Martin-L\"{o}f style
dependency, the session types of TLLC allow protocols to specify properties of
communicated messages. When used in conjunction with the dependent type
machinery already present in TLL, dependent session types facilitate a form of
relational verification by relating concurrent programs with their idealized
sequential counterparts. Correctness properties proven for sequential programs
can be easily lifted to their corresponding concurrent implementations. TLLC
makes session types a powerful tool for intrinsically verifying the correctness
of data structures such as queues and concurrent algorithms such as map-reduce.
To extend TLL with session types, we develop a novel formulation of
intuitionistic session type which we believe to be widely applicable for
integrating session types into other type systems beyond the context of TLLC.
We study the meta-theory of our language, proving its soundness as both a term
calculus and a process calculus. To demonstrate the practicality of TLLC, we
have implemented a prototype compiler that translates TLLC programs into
concurrent C code, which has been extensively evaluated.

### [3] [Impartial Selection with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19002)
*Javier Cembrano,Felix Fischer,Max Klimm*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了基于相互提名的代理人选择问题，提出了在预测支持下改进公正机制性能的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理人在选择和被选择过程中可能会歪曲对其他人的资格的真实看法，从而影响自己的选择机会。公正机制通过保证代理人的选择独立于其提名来解决这一问题。

Method: 在预测支持下，研究了公正机制的性能改进。具体来说，提出了在预测准确时的一致性界限和预测不准确时的鲁棒性界限，并给出了不同情境下的机制设计。

Result: 在一般情境下，给出了一个一致性为$1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$和鲁棒性为$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$的机制。在选择单一代理人的特殊情境下，证明了1-一致性和1/2-鲁棒性可以同时实现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在几乎不牺牲鲁棒性的情况下，可以实现渐进最优的一致性。

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As
agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent
their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own
chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by
guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations
cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the
performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to
what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are
given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness
of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when
the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents
are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a
mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness
$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a
single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that
$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A
close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal
consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

### [4] [Desirable Effort Fairness and Optimality Trade-offs in Strategic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19098)
*Valia Efthymiou,Ekaterina Fedorova,Chara Podimata*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 战略学习研究决策规则如何与可能策略性改变输入/特征的代理交互。传统模型假设决策者目标是最大化预测准确性，而忽略了外部激励效应和公平性。本文统一了主代理交互模型，考虑了特征因果依赖、异质操作成本和同伴学习，并提供了理论保证和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统战略学习模型仅关注预测准确性，忽略了决策系统可能的外部激励效应和公平性需求。本文旨在探索如何在最大化目标的同时限制代理间的激励差距。

Method: 本文提出一个统一的主代理交互模型，引入了三个关键组件：特征的因果依赖、代理间异质的操作成本以及通过同伴学习推断决策规则的机制。

Result: 通过理论分析和真实数据集实验，证明了在限制激励差距的情况下，决策者在准确性最大化与公平性之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 本文模型为战略学习提供了更全面的框架，突出了在实际决策系统中考虑外部激励和公平性的重要性，并通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Strategic learning studies how decision rules interact with agents who may
strategically change their inputs/features to achieve better outcomes. In
standard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to
learn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that
agents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align
exclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external
effects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of
certain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the
principal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across
heterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e.,
maximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the
principal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that
captures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal
dependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others;
(2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning,
through which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular
desirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness
measures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit
tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort.

Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for
e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of
auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed
in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding
algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent
evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)
autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms
from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal
formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the
most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately
emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use
cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising
drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the
evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding
algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice
of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where
autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners
to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives
and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.

### [6] [Comparing Uniform Price and Discriminatory Multi-Unit Auctions through Regret Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19591)
*Marius Potfer,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文比较了统一价格拍卖和歧视性拍卖在多轮重复拍卖中的学习难度，发现两者的最坏情况遗憾类似，但在某些场景下，统一价格拍卖可能具有更快的学习速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮重复拍卖中最常见的两种拍卖形式（统一价格和歧视性拍卖）的学习难度，特别是从单一投标者对抗随机对手的学习角度。

Method: 通过分析两种拍卖形式在全信息和波段反馈下的遗憾尺度，揭示其结构差异，并在对称且具有单位需求的其他参与者拍卖场景中进行具体分析。

Result: 结果显示，两种拍卖形式的最坏情况遗憾尺度类似（$	ilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ 和 $	ilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$），但在某些场景下，统一价格拍卖的遗憾尺度可能更快（$	ilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$）。

Conclusion: 统一价格拍卖在某些情境下可能更适合学习速度要求高的场景，而歧视性拍卖则保持稳定的学习难度。

Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical
items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and
treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and
discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder
learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning
difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both
auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively.
However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences:
uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain
at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for
auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand,
and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.

### [7] [On Minimal Achievable Quotas in Multiwinner Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19620)
*Patrick Becker,Fabian Frank*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于批准的多数票选举中的比例公理，提出了实例依赖性配额的概念，并展示了常见投票规则与最优解的距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统比例公理（JR和EJR）依赖固定配额（如Hare或Droop），限制了灵活性。本研究旨在探索实例依赖性配额的可能性。

Method: 引入实例依赖性配额的比例概念，分析投票规则的最优解距离，并提出整数线性规划（ILP）方法来计算满足α-JR的委员会。

Result: 证明所有常见投票规则与最优解的距离为$\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$，并且确定满足α-JR的最优α值是NP完全的。在特定领域（VI和CI）中得到积极结果。

Conclusion: 实例依赖性配额为比例公理提供了灵活性，但计算复杂度较高。ILP方法在特定情况下可行，扩展了研究的应用范围。

Abstract: Justified representation (JR) and extended justified representation (EJR) are
well-established proportionality axioms in approval-based multiwinner voting.
Both axioms are always satisfiable, but they rely on a fixed quota (typically
Hare or Droop), with the Droop quota being the smallest one that guarantees
existence across all instances. With this observation in mind, we take a first
step beyond the fixed-quota paradigm and introduce proportionality notions
where the quota is instance-dependent. We demonstrate that all commonly studied
voting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of
$\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our
instance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of
$\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\alpha$-JR is NP-complete. To
address this, we introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for
computing committees that satisfy $\alpha$-JR, and we provide positive results
in the voter interval (VI) and candidate interval (CI) domains.
