TL;DR: PoissonNet是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过局部-全局学习方案解决网格学习中高频特征学习、感受野不足、离散化敏感和计算开销低效等问题，利用泊松方程实现特征传播，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习架构在学习高频特征、感受野、离散化敏感性和计算效率之间存在复杂权衡，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入PoissonNet，采用局部-全局学习框架，在网格梯度域进行局部特征变换，并通过求解泊松系统全局传播特征更新。

Result: PoissonNet在高频特征保留、全局感受野、计算效率和网格无关性方面表现优异，在语义分割和动画表面参数化任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PoissonNet通过学习变形等任务显著优于现有表面学习方法，证明了其在网格处理中的高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

### [2] [HITrees: Higher-Order Interaction Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14558)
*Amir Mohammad Fadaei Ayyam,Michael Sammler*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种支持高阶效应的交互树变体（HITrees），解决了传统交互树无法处理高阶效应的问题，并通过Lean证明助手实现了一套全面的效应库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，组合语义学在复杂系统的形式验证中变得重要。交互树作为一种流行的指称语义，虽然实现了组合性，但其效应概念无法支持高阶效应，而这些效应对于建模并行组合和call/cc等复杂语义特征至关重要。因此，需要一种新的方法来支持高阶效应。

Method: 本文提出Higher-Order Interaction Trees（HITrees），通过两种关键技术实现高阶效应支持：1）设计效应概念以表达高阶输入的定点为归纳类型；2）使用脱函数化将高阶输出编码为一阶表示。

Result: HITrees在Lean证明助手中实现，并配备了包括并发、递归和call/cc在内的效应库。此外，提供了HITrees的两种解释：状态转换系统和单子程序。应用HITrees成功定义了一个支持并行组合和call/cc的语言语义。

Conclusion: HITrees是第一种在非保护类型理论中支持高阶效应的交互树变体，为解决高阶效应问题提供了有效方法，并通过实际应用验证了其表达能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rise of compositional semantics as a
foundation for formal verification of complex systems. In particular,
interaction trees have emerged as a popular denotational semantics. Interaction
trees achieve compositionality by providing a reusable library of effects.
However, their notion of effects does not support higher-order effects, i.e.,
effects that take or return monadic computations. Such effects are essential to
model complex semantic features like parallel composition and call/cc.
  We introduce Higher-Order Interaction Trees (HITrees), the first variant of
interaction trees to support higher-order effects in a non-guarded type theory.
HITrees accomplish this through two key techniques: first, by designing the
notion of effects such that the fixpoints of effects with higher-order input
can be expressed as inductive types inside the type theory; and second, using
defunctionalization to encode higher-order outputs into a first-order
representation. We implement HITrees in the Lean proof assistant, accompanied
by a comprehensive library of effects including concurrency, recursion, and
call/cc. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of HITrees, as state
transition systems and as monadic programs. To demonstrate the expressiveness
of HITrees, we apply them to define the semantics of a language with parallel
composition and call/cc.

### [3] [Why Instant-Runoff Voting Is So Resilient to Coalitional Manipulation: Phase Transitions in the Perturbed Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14450)
*François Durand*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究发现即时决选投票（IRV）对联盟操纵（CM）高度抵抗，并在Perturbed Culture模型中分析了三种投票规则的CM易感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补关于IRV为何对联盟操纵具有高度抵抗力的理论空白。

Method: 在Perturbed Culture模型中分析多数投票、两轮制和IRV对CM的易感性，并引入超级孔多塞赢家（SCW）的概念。

Result: 每种规则在偏好集中度的临界值θ_c处经历相变，且IRV的θ_c为0，使其即使在最小偏好集中度下也能抵抗CM。

Conclusion: SCW的存在是IRV抵抗联盟操纵的关键，这一发现为IRV的高抵抗力提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

### [4] [Co-Investment under Revenue Uncertainty Based on Stochastic Coalitional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14555)
*Amal Sakr,Andrea Araldo,Tijani Chahed,Daniel Kofman*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于随机联盟游戏的共投资方案，旨在解决移动边缘计算（MEC）部署中成本和收益共享的问题，并通过稳健博弈理论推导出大联盟稳定性的概率下限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于移动边缘计算（MEC）等服务需要大量投资，单一利益相关者（如基础设施提供商）无法独立承担。因此，需要服务提供商等利益相关者共同投资，但未来收益的不确定性带来了挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于稳健博弈理论的随机联盟游戏模型，旨在分析共投资方案的稳定性和盈利能力，特别是在收益波动的情况下。

Result: 数值结果表明，当服务提供商的收益相似且投资周期足够长时，大联盟的稳定性概率下限较高；而在收益波动较大时，尽管稳定性下限较低，共投资仍然具有盈利能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为移动边缘计算等服务的共投资提供了理论框架，证明了在收益相似且投资周期长的条件下，共投资方案具有较高的稳定性，并且在收益波动时仍能保持盈利能力。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于解决区块链网络中MEV（最大可提取价值）提取的高频、部分可观测环境下的战略挑战，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链网络中MEV提取的机制从公开竞价转变为密封竞价，导致传统的博弈论方法在高频、部分可观测环境下失效，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了一个强化学习框架，包括：1）模拟Polygon Atlas拍卖中套利机会和竞争的随机环境；2）基于PPO的实时竞价代理；3）历史条件化的自适应策略。

Result: 实验表明，该代理在现有搜索者中捕获49%的利润，替换市场领导者后可达81%，显著优于静态竞价策略。

Conclusion: 强化学习在高频MEV环境中具有关键优势，为工业参与者和协议设计者提供了直接价值。

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

### [7] [Learnable Mixed Nash Equilibria are Collectively Rational](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14907)
*Geelon So,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了非渐进稳定性动态下的博弈学习，提出了均匀稳定性的概念，揭示了其与集体理性经济特性的紧密联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是扩展博弈学习的研究范围，探索非渐进稳定性动态下的均衡行为及其与集体理性的关系。

Method: 通过均匀稳定性的概念分析混合均衡的性质，并结合增量平滑最佳响应动态家族的迭代收敛行为进行研究。

Result: 研究表明，在非退化条件下，若混合均衡不具均匀稳定性，则不具备弱帕累托最优性；反之，局部均匀稳定的均衡则具有弱帕累托最优性。

Conclusion: 论文结论指出，个体效用追求行为在混合纳什均衡附近能够实现集体理性，这与严格均衡附近的行为可能导致社会低效解不同。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.
