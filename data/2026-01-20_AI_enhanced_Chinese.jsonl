This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u4e14\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5747\u8861\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u6784AI\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u504f\u597d\u5de5\u7a0b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\u7684\u673a\u6784AI\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u673a\u6784AI\uff0c\u4ee5\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u91cd\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5f00\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u6cd5\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u5236\u88c1\u548c\u6062\u590d\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7531Oracle/Controller\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u65e0\u6cbb\u7406\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\uff08\u4ec5\u63d0\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u673a\u6784\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\u7684\u673a\u6784\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u5c42\u7ea7\u4ece3.1\u964d\u81f31.8\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5408\u8c0b\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4ece50%\u964d\u81f35.6%\u3002\u4ec5\u63d0\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u673a\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u56fe\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $\u03c1>1$ the problem is not $\u03c1$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86minCost-EFx\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3EFx\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u6210\u672c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6216\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86minCost-EFx\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0b\u5df2\u4e3aNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6838\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u9664\u975eP=NP\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u53d7\u9650\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6838\u5fc3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.\n  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications.

ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236DAC-ALNS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Dual Actor-Critic\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3aALNS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u7834\u574f\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfALNS\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7834\u574f\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u64cd\u4f5c\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Dual Actor-Critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7834\u574f\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDAC-ALNS\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u9898\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DAC-ALNS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408DAC\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ALNS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.", "AI": {"tldr": "Qihe \u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9 Verilog \u7684\u901a\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002Qihe \u7684\u63a8\u51fa\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u786c\u4ef6\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "Qihe \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6790\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u3001Verilog \u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08IR\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5982\u4f4d\u5411\u91cf\u7b97\u672f\u3001\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e76\u53d1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQihe \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 9 \u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u300118 \u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 16 \u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "Qihe \u7684\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u540e\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u786c\u4ef6\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7e41\u8363\u3002"}}

We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the \"Poisoned Apple\" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bae\u4ef7\u3001\u8c08\u5224\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u589e\u52a0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u53d8\u5747\u8861\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u201c\u6bd2\u82f9\u679c\u201d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6218\u7565\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u8bae\u4ef7\u3001\u8c08\u5224\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u573a\u666f\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u6218\u7565\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff09\u6765\u5206\u6790AI\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5747\u8861\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u201c\u6bd2\u82f9\u679c\u201d\u6548\u5e94\u2014\u2014\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u53d1\u5e03\u6280\u672f\u6765\u64cd\u63a7\u76d1\u7ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6613\u53d7\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u3002"}}
