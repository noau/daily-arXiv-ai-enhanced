While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent\nformal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming\nlanguages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this\ndichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an\nexecuting program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming\nlanguage. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within\nthe programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the\napplication domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic\nlifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain\nthe operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and\nvirtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection\nlayer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case\nstudy of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the\ntechnique.

Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address\nsparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,\nas well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of\nstates and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with\ngeneration uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between\nadjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss\nof ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a\nhighly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal\nauto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed\nCBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random\nvariable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the\ngoal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated\nsequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model\nto refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'\nobjectives.
