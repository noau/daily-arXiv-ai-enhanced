Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7ed8\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u7eed\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b\u800c\u7eaf\u8868\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u8f6f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u534a\u900f\u660e\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u5230\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.\n  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting.

Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u914d\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u914d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u914d\u97f3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Marden"], "title": "Alliance Mechanisms in General Lotto Games", "comment": null, "summary": "How do different alliance mechanisms compare? In this work, we analyze various methods of forming an alliance in the Coalitional General Lotto game, a simple model of competitive resource allocation. In the game, Players 1 and 2 independently compete against a common Adversary by allocating their limited resource budgets towards separate sets of contests; an agent wins a contest by allocating more resources towards it than their opponent. In this setting, we study three alliance mechanisms: budget transfers (resource donation), contest transfers (contest redistribution), and joint transfers (both simultaneously). For all three mechanisms, we study when they present opportunities for collective improvement (the sum of the Players' payoffs increases) or mutual improvement (both Players' individual payoffs increase). In our first result, we show that all three are fundamentally different with regards to mutual improvement; in particular, mutually beneficial budget and contest transfers exist in distinct, limited subsets of games, whereas mutually beneficial joint transfers exist in almost all games. However, in our second result, we demonstrate that all three mechanisms are equivalent when it comes to collective improvement; that is, collectively beneficial budget, contest, and joint transfers exist in almost all game instances, and all three mechanisms achieve the same maximum collective payoff. Together, these results demonstrate that differences between mechanisms depend fundamentally on the objective of the alliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u8054\u76df\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u76df\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u96c6\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8054\u76df\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u8054\u76df\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u76df\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u6350\u8d60\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u5728\u8054\u76df\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5728\u96c6\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u8d44\u6e90\u6350\u8d60\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6e38\u620f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u76df\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8054\u76df\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96c6\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4e92\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}
