In this challenging setting, traditional\nimage stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other\nartifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content\nconsistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with\nsynthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodel to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference\nimages. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single\nreference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that\nfaithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and\nthe consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured\ndatasets."}
