  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的服装材料具有高度复杂性和空间变化性，传统的有限元模拟方法计算成本高且易受“膜锁定”数值伪影的影响，导致布料显得过于僵硬。

Method: 该方法将布料离散化为一个质量-弹簧网络，通过一种新颖的力和冲量损失函数，直接从运动数据中学习未知的材料参数。

Result: 该方法能够准确建模来自不同数据源的空间变化材料特性，且不受有限元方法中“膜锁定”问题的影响，训练速度更快，重建精度更高，在新动态场景下的泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net框架提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，用于模拟复杂服装材料的动态行为，优于传统的图网络和神经网络ODE架构。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

### [2] [BANG: Dividing 3D Assets via Generative Exploded Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21493)
*Longwen Zhang,Qixuan Zhang,Haoran Jiang,Yinuo Bai,Wei Yang,Lan Xu,Jingyi Yu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: BANG是一种新型生成方法，通过“生成爆炸动力学”实现3D物体的直观且灵活的部分级分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D设计工具难以模拟人类自然分解与重组对象的能力，BANG旨在解决这一问题，降低艺术专业门槛。

Method: BANG利用预训练的大规模潜在扩散模型，结合轻量级爆炸视图适配器，实现精确的分解控制，并通过时间注意力模块确保过渡平滑。

Result: BANG能生成详细的部分级几何结构，支持功能性描述关联，并应用于3D打印等工作流程。

Conclusion: BANG通过融合生成与推理，提供了一种符合人类直觉的新型3D创作视角。

Abstract: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to
deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,
current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring
considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a
novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing
for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart
of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of
exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while
preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned
for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing
precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal
attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG
enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface
regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This
interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling
2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,
associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating
component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG
offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for
easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation
from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on
creation that resonates with human intuition.

### [3] [One Weird Trick to Untie Landin's Knot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21317)
*Paulette Koronkevich,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Landin's Knot在编码递归中的作用，指出高阶引用本身并不导致非终止，关键在于对函数环境的无限制量化。通过闭包转换语言，揭示了如何利用impredicative量化编码递归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Landin's Knot在编码递归中的作用，澄清高阶引用对非终止的影响，并探索如何在不使用复杂类型系统（如线性）的情况下安全地添加高阶引用。

Method: 通过闭包转换语言，将函数环境显式化，并通过impredicative量化隐藏环境类型，研究高阶引用在此环境下的行为。

Result: 发现高阶引用本身不导致非终止，而是无限制的环境量化是关键。提出限制环境量化可以安全添加高阶引用而不依赖复杂类型系统。

Conclusion: 通过限制对函数环境的量化，可以安全地引入高阶引用，而无需复杂的类型系统或函数存储限制。

Abstract: In this work, we explore Landin's Knot, which is understood as a pattern for
encoding general recursion, including non-termination, that is possible after
adding higher-order references to an otherwise terminating language. We observe
that this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't
lead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not
primarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification
over a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted
language, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the
type of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references
are added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode
recursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the
environment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating
languages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,
and without restricting references from storing functions.

### [4] [Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming: A Concise and Elegant Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21439)
*Yong Qi Foo,Brian Sze-Kai Cheong,Michael D. Adams*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 固定点导向编程（FPOP）是一种新兴范式，旨在简化自引用计算问题的实现，如图算法、静态分析和分布式计算。FPOP通过高级抽象、结构化推理规则和用户引导的优化，减少实现复杂性并提高适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程范式缺乏对固定点计算的直接支持，导致实现复杂且易错。FPOP旨在填补这一空白，提供简洁表达和高效执行的能力。

Method: FPOP利用结构化推理规则和用户引导优化，使开发者能够编写声明式规范，编译器确保高效执行。

Result: FPOP显著简化了算法实现，例如图距离问题仅需两行代码，而传统范式需要更多代码。它还提升了可维护性和快速原型设计能力。

Conclusion: FPOP通过弥合理论固定点公式与实际实现间的差距，为研究和采用这一范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) is an emerging paradigm designed to
streamline the implementation of problems involving self-referential
computations. These include graph algorithms, static analysis, parsing, and
distributed computing-domains that traditionally require complex and
tricky-to-implement work-queue algorithms. Existing programming paradigms lack
direct support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to
inefficient and error-prone implementations.
  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a
high-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem
formulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed
optimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while
the compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation
complexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for
programmers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without
modifying the core logic of their program.
  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves
maintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be
clearly and concisely expressed. For example, the graph distance problem can be
expressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an
order of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap between
theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim to
foster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

### [5] [Composable Effect Handling for Programming LLM-integrated Scripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22048)
*Di Wang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用可组合效应处理（composable effect handling）分离工作流逻辑与效应操作（如LLM调用、I/O和并发），在不牺牲模块化的同时实现性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM集成脚本在模块化和性能方面面临挑战，脚本往往与特定LLM实现耦合，且难以利用并行化机会。

Method: 通过将效应操作（如LLM调用、I/O和并发）视为抽象接口，并使用效应处理器（effect handlers）来实现，从而分离逻辑与操作。

Result: 研究表明，该方法在不影响模块化的情况下显著提升性能（例如，在“思维树”案例中实现10倍加速）。

Conclusion: 论文旨在推广可组合效应处理作为LLM脚本编程的一种风格。

Abstract: Implementing LLM-integrated scripts introduces challenges in modularity and
performance, as scripts are often coupled to specific LLM implementations and
fail to exploit parallelization opportunities. This paper proposes using
composable effect handling to separate workflow logic from effectful
operations, such as LLM calls, I/O, and concurrency, enabling modularity
without sacrificing the opportunity for performance optimization. By treating
these operations as abstract interfaces and discharging them via effect
handlers, this paper shows that scripts can achieve significant speedups (e.g.,
10$\times$ in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) without compromising modularity.
This paper aims to promote composable effect handling as a programming style
for LLM scripting.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用承诺来实施非强制性敲诈的机制，通过奖励而非惩罚来重塑战略互动，揭示了竞争环境中的战略漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦于利用承诺实现高效均衡，但其在非效率目标中的应用潜力未被充分探索。论文旨在探索承诺在非强制性敲诈中的应用。

Method: 通过引入基于结果的支付承诺，将顺序性引入同步移动博弈，重塑战略互动。分析了敲诈成功的条件、易受影响的博弈类型、最大可提取利润和最小支付需求，并以2x2博弈为例说明。

Result: 研究发现，简单的战略设定也可能受此敲诈机制影响，揭示了竞争环境中的战略漏洞，对经济市场、外交关系和区块链多代理系统具有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了博弈论中对承诺的理解，提出了如何保护战略互动免受非强制性敲诈剥削的关键问题。

Abstract: Commitments play a crucial role in game theory, shaping strategic
interactions by either altering a player's own payoffs or influencing the
incentives of others through outcome-contingent payments. While most research
has focused on using commitments to achieve efficient equilibria, their
potential applications beyond this goal remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages
commitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or
external agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening
punishment. At the core of the mechanism is the introduction of sequentiality
into a simultaneous-move game, fundamentally reshaping the strategic
interaction. We derive the conditions under which extortion is successful,
identify the class of games susceptible to this scheme, and determine both the
maximum extractable profit and the minimum required payment. To illustrate the
extortion mechanism, we apply it to 2x2 games, highlighting how even simple
strategic settings can be vulnerable to this form of manipulation. Our results
reveal strategic vulnerabilities in competitive settings, with significant
implications for economic markets, diplomatic relations, and multi-agent
systems operating in blockchain environments. This work broadens our
understanding of commitments in game theory and raises critical questions about
how to safeguard strategic interactions from exploitation through non-coercive
extortion.
