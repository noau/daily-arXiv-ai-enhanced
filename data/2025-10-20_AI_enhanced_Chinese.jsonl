While classical\neconomic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern\napplications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation\nand blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is\nno longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such\ncontracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to\n\\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic\nmechanism design two decades ago.\n  This article focuses on \\emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier\nwithin algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially\nmany combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a\nteam, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models\ncapture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals\ncoordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of\nengineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)\na single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary\nactions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,\nwe highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity\nbarriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward\nfunctions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and\ndemand-oracle access.

Since the buyer gains greater utility through\nbetter decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the\nseller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price.

Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency\nin static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the\nseverity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality\nobject-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we\naugment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically\ndesigned to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false\ntransparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially\nreduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on\nstandard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u865a\u5047\u900f\u660e\u8868\u9762\u95ee\u9898\uff0cNGS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u65af\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u865a\u5047\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "NGS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u65af\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8868\u9762\u9ad8\u65af\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6cfc\u6e85\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNGS\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6e32\u67d3\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NGS\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u89e3\u51b33DGS\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u900f\u660e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor\nresponsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service\nProviders (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn\nrevenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant\ninvestment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose\nco-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple\nSPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a\nlong period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future,\nplayers may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment\n(such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a\nscheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of\n(i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii)\nadjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We\npropose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to\nappropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment.

In the 1980s,\nRobert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit\nfor Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for\nthe first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted\nFortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises\nquestions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.\nWe recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran\nimplementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python\ninterface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.\nUsing the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce\nAxelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be\ncooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings\nremain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally\nsubmitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of\nthe largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was\nespecially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the\noriginal submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that\nseveral lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and\nunder noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of\nAxelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original\nresults in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,\neasy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within\nAxelrod-Python to support future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u73b0Axelrod\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u573a\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TFT\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1Axelrod\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u539f\u59cbFortran\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaPython\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Axelrod-Python\u5e93\u8fd0\u884c\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0Axelrod\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u4e86Axelrod\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aTFT\u7b56\u7565\u80dc\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u80cc\u53db\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u5e76\u613f\u610f\u539f\u8c05\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u5bf9TFT\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5608\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f83\u4e0d\u77e5\u540d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86Axelrod\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u573a\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f53\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}
