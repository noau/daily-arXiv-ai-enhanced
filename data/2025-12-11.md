Motivation: 为了解决3D形状重建中保真度与简洁性之间的权衡问题，论文旨在开发一种既能高精度重建又能保持可编辑性的方法。

Method: 论文提出了SuperFrustum基元（兼具表达性、可编辑性和可优化性）和ResFit算法（一种无监督的迭代拟合方法），通过全局形状分析和局部优化的结合，实现对输入的3D形状进行紧凑且准确的分解。

Result: 在多样化的3D基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的成果，IoU提升了超过9个百分点，同时使用的基元数量比之前的工作减少近一半。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地弥合了密集3D数据与可控设计之间的差距，生成了高保真且可编辑的形状程序。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for converting 3D shapes into compact and editable assemblies of analytic primitives, directly addressing the persistent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and parsimony. Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.

### [2] [Simple Modal Types for Functional Reactive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09412)
*Patrick Bahr*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的函数式响应式编程（FRP）语言，通过简化的模态类型系统，保证了因果性、生产性和无空间泄漏的核心操作特性，同时提高了语言的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的功能性响应式编程（FRP）语言虽然通过模态类型系统确保了程序的时间特性，但限制了表达性。本文提出了一种新的FRP语言，通过简化模态类型系统和引入可控的‘可变引用’信号语义，增强了表达性同时保持了核心操作特性。

Method: 介绍了一种新的FRP语言，改进了信号的语义模型，将其视为由‘later’模态类型严格控制的‘可变引用’。这种语义模型允许更多程序通过类型检查，同时通过改进的信号更新机制提升了效率。

Result: 新语言的模态类型系统相较于现有方法减少了限制，但依然保证了程序的时间特性（因果性、生产性和无空间泄漏）。此外，改进的信号语义使得语言表达性更强，同时支持更高效的信号更新操作。

Conclusion: 通过重新设计信号的语义模型和简化模态类型系统，新FRP语言在保持核心操作特性的同时，显著提升了表达性和效率，为FRP的实用化提供了新的可能。

Abstract: Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed.
  We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.

### [3] [The Illusion of Rationality: Tacit Bias and Strategic Dominance in Frontier LLM Negotiation Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09254)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在谈判场景中的表现，发现模型并未因推理能力提升而趋于理性或一致，反而展现出模型特定的策略偏差和锚定效应，凸显了在实际部署前解决这些问题的紧迫性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在谈判等社交场景中的自主代理应用增多，其策略行为的不可预测性可能带来风险，故研究其谈判行为的实际表现。

Method: 研究采用NegotiationArena框架，在三种多轮谈判游戏（买家卖家、多轮最后通牒、资源交换）中对前沿LLMs进行控制性模拟实验，分析其策略行为。

Result: 实验表明LLMs的策略行为未趋于统一最优解，而是分化为模型特定的均衡；初始报价对最终协议有显著预测性，且模型表现出数值和语义锚定效应，部分模型还展现出系统性优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了LLMs在谈判中的策略偏差和锚定效应，强调在实际部署前亟需开发机制以缓解这些问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents on behalf of institutions and individuals in economic, political, and social settings that involve negotiation. Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of designing procurement auctions for the strategic uncapacitated facility location problem: a company needs to procure a set of facility locations in order to serve its customers and each facility location is owned by a strategic agent. Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \emph{frugality ratio}.
  We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally provide a family of ``error-tolerant'' auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error.
