Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low."}

Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.

In this work, we\nintroduce and study a restriction of this problem under the additional\nconstraint that edges added to $G$ to reach $M(G)$ must form a walk (i.e., a\npath with possibly repeated edges and vertices) of $G$. We investigate the\ngeneral consequences of having this additional constraint, and provide several\nresults of different natures (structural, combinatorial, algorithmic) on the\nlength of the shortest irregularising walks, for general graphs and more\nrestricted classes."}

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low."}

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.

Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy\nby leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et\nal.'s randomized response technique~\\cite{ELRS23, and a novel analysis,\nyielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are\nthe first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike\nprior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show\nsubstantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x\nof exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala\net al.~\\cite{DLRSSY22}. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative\napproximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining\ncompetitive runtime."}

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low."}

When the snake reaches the apple, it grows longer, and a new apple\nappears. A graph on which the snake has a strategy to keep eating apples until\nit covers all the vertices of the graph is called snake-winnable. We prove that\ndetermining whether a graph is snake-winnable is NP-hard, even when restricted\nto grid graphs. We fully characterize snake-winnable graphs for odd-sized\nbipartite graphs and graphs with vertex-connectivity 1. While Hamiltonian\ngraphs are always snake-winnable, we show that non-Hamiltonian snake-winnable\ngraphs have a girth of at most 6 and that this bound is tight."}

Our goal is to select $k$ vantage points from $V$\nthat reveal the maximum number of bottleneck edge capacities.\n  We consider both a non-adaptive setting where all $k$ vantage points are\nselected before any bottleneck capacity is revealed, and an adaptive setting\nwhere each vantage point selection instantly reveals bottleneck capacities\nalong all shortest paths starting from that point. In the non-adaptive setting,\nby considering a relaxed model where edge capacities are drawn from a random\npermutation (which still leaves the problem of maximizing the expected number\nof revealed edges NP-hard), we are able to give a $1-1/e$ approximate\nalgorithm. In the adaptive setting we work with the least permissive model\nwhere edge capacities are arbitrarily fixed but unknown. We compare with the\nbest solution for the particular input instance (i.e. by enumerating all\nchoices of $k$ tuples), and provide both lower bounds on instance optimal\napproximation algorithms and upper bounds for trees and planar graphs."}

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low."}

These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al.

To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

The model is\ntrained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to\nstabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both\nqualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D\nGAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image\nsynthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing.

We show that ECP/\\alpha is fixed-parameter tractable, whereas\nECC/\\alpha is NP-complete for all k \\geq 2, yet can be solved in polynomial\ntime for k \\in {0,1}. These findings highlight intriguing differences between\nthe two problems when viewed through the lens of parameterization above a\nnatural lower bound.\n  Finally, we demonstrate that ECC/\\alpha becomes fixed-parameter tractable\nwhen parameterized by k + \\omega(G), where \\omega(G) is the size of a maximum\nclique of the graph G. This result is particularly relevant for sparse graphs,\nin which \\omega is typically small. For H-minor free graphs, we design a\nsubexponential algorithm of running time f(H)^{\\sqrt{k}}n^{O(1)}."}

We are given a\ngraph $G=(V, E)$ whose edges $E$ have unknown capacity values that are to be\ndiscovered. Probes from a vantage point, i.e, a vertex $v \\in V$, along\nshortest paths from $v$ to all other vertices, reveal bottleneck edge\ncapacities along each path. Our goal is to select $k$ vantage points from $V$\nthat reveal the maximum number of bottleneck edge capacities.\n  We consider both a non-adaptive setting where all $k$ vantage points are\nselected before any bottleneck capacity is revealed, and an adaptive setting\nwhere each vantage point selection instantly reveals bottleneck capacities\nalong all shortest paths starting from that point. In the non-adaptive setting,\nby considering a relaxed model where edge capacities are drawn from a random\npermutation (which still leaves the problem of maximizing the expected number\nof revealed edges NP-hard), we are able to give a $1-1/e$ approximate\nalgorithm. In the adaptive setting we work with the least permissive model\nwhere edge capacities are arbitrarily fixed but unknown. We compare with the\nbest solution for the particular input instance (i.e. by enumerating all\nchoices of $k$ tuples), and provide both lower bounds on instance optimal\napproximation algorithms and upper bounds for trees and planar graphs."}

For graphs, support for computing over\ncompressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data\nstructures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same,\nworst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.\n  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically\nimproves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently\nsupporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access).\nSpecifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal\nspace when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\\'asi-Albert model\nof preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for\narbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an\nentropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful\nanalysis of the instance-optimal space usage."}
