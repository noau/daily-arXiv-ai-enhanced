### [1] [TFZ: Topology-Preserving Compression of 2D Symmetric and Asymmetric Second-Order Tensor Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09235)
*Nathaniel Gorski,Xin Liang,Hanqi Guo,Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TFZ的新型压缩框架，它在压缩2D对称和非对称二阶张量场时保留了数据的拓扑结构，确保核心特征不丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量场在科学和工程中至关重要，但其压缩可能破坏拓扑结构，影响后续分析和可视化。TFZ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TFZ通过扫描每个网格单元并保留其局部拓扑，确保对称张量场的退化点和非对称张量场的特征向量/值图得以保留。

Result: TFZ成功增强了SZ3和SPERR等科学数据压缩器的性能，证明了其在保留拓扑结构的同时进行有效压缩的能力。

Conclusion: TFZ能够在压缩过程中保留张量场的核心拓扑特征，为科学数据的压缩和分析提供了可靠的支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves
the topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined
on flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor - a
multi-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields,
such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are
essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields
captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such
as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for
analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may
distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and
visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are
preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate
points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains
eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric
tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of
each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We
showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific
data compressors SZ3 and SPERR.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DualPhys-GS框架通过双路径优化机制和双特征引导的衰减散射建模，实现了高质量的水下3D重建，解决了传统方法因水介质特性导致的颜色失真和几何伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气光学模型在水下场景重建中无法有效处理水介质特有的光波长选择性衰减和悬浮颗粒散射效应，导致颜色失真和几何伪影。

Method: 提出DualPhys-GS框架，包含RGB引导的衰减优化模型和多尺度深度感知散射模型，设计了多种特殊损失函数和场景自适应机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在悬浮物密集区域和长距离场景中优于现有方法，重建质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DualPhys-GS框架能有效处理水下场景重建中的独特挑战，提供高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: In 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes, traditional methods based on
atmospheric optical models cannot effectively deal with the selective
attenuation of light wavelengths and the effect of suspended particle
scattering, which are unique to the water medium, and lead to color distortion,
geometric artifacts, and collapsing phenomena at long distances. We propose the
DualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through
a dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual
feature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided
attenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and
can handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale
depth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales
using a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we
design several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency
loss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss
dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss
is used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature
loss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we
design a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the
water-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid
coastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation
parameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended
matter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality
is significantly improved.

### [3] [Invertible Syntax without the Tuples (Functional Pearl)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09856)
*Mathieu Boespflug,Arnaud Spiwack*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文回顾了Olivier Danvy的连续性传递方法，探讨其在现代解析和打印结构化数据中的应用，并提出三种基于连续性传递风格的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，关于可逆语法描述的讨论转向了应用式、单子式或箭头式的组合器库，但忽略了连续性传递的重要性。本文旨在证明Danvy的见解在更广泛的情境中依然适用。

Method: 本文提出了三种利用连续性传递风格的解决方案，作为依赖类型和通过嵌套对的单子聚合的替代方法，用于解析和打印结构化数据。

Result: 研究表明，连续性传递方法在解析和打印结构化数据时具有更高的表达能力，并能处理列表和树等归纳结构。

Conclusion: Danvy的连续性传递方法在现代设置中仍然具有重要价值，能够为解析和打印结构化数据提供高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the seminal paper Functional unparsing, Olivier Danvy used continuation
passing to reanalyse printf-like format strings as combinators. In the
intervening decades, the conversation shifted towards a concurrent line of work
-- applicative, monadic or arrow-based combinator libraries -- in an effort to
find combinators for invertible syntax descriptions that simultaneously
determine a parser as well as a printer, and with more expressive power, able
to handle inductive structures such as lists and trees. Along the way,
continuation passing got lost. This paper argues that Danvy's insight remains
as relevant to the general setting as it was to the restricted setting of his
original paper. Like him, we present three solutions that exploit
continuation-passing style as an alternative to both dependent types and
monoidal aggregation via nested pairs, in our case to parse and print
structured data with increasing expressive power.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过碳定价引导交通流量以实现排放预算平衡，证明了在适当的定价下，所有可行的排放目标都可以作为Wardrop均衡实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通是全球碳排放的重要来源，如何通过碳定价引导交通流量以实现排放预算平衡是一个重要的研究问题。

Method: 研究了多商品流模型，通过对外部性（如碳排放）定价，分析Wardrop均衡的实现条件，并提出了计算均衡价格的方法。

Result: 证明了所有可行流量均可通过定价作为Wardrop均衡实现，并给出了在特定条件下计算均衡价格的算法。

Conclusion: 碳定价是实现交通网络中所有可行排放目标的可行且易于处理的方法。

Abstract: Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we
study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that
respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general
multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These
externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the
traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.
  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as
Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More
precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible
flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting
appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there
are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of
existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are
non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a
convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a
suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the
total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For
increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a
single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all
equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are
networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that
the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.
This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit
schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under
mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in
traffic networks.

### [5] [Collective dynamics of strategic classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09340)
*Marta C. Couto,Flavia Barsotti,Fernando P. Santos*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文通过进化博弈论研究了用户战略适应与算法重新训练之间的反馈循环，分析了其对集体动态的影响，并以信用贷款算法为例测试了干预措施的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章旨在探讨人工智能分类算法在高风险决策（如金融、医疗等）中，用户战略适应与算法重新训练之间的互动关系，以及如何减轻这种互动带来的负面影响。

Method: 使用进化博弈论框架，研究了用户集体与机构之间的反馈动力学，并通过信用贷款算法的案例测试了多种交互情景和干预措施。

Result: 研究发现，当算法不具备抗战略操纵能力时，用户或需支付高额成本以满足机构要求，或会通过提供虚假信息游戏算法。提高游戏检测能力和提供算法补救措施可降低社会成本并推动用户改进。

Conclusion: 论文指出，机构的重新适应速度对结果有重要影响，同时首次发现了严格机构为失败用户提供可操作补救措施时的循环动态现象。

Abstract: Classification algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are nowadays
applied in high-stakes decisions in finance, healthcare, criminal justice, or
education. Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered
about classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which
collective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms'
retraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our
framework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of
feedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test
interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a
case study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.
We consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction
paradigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we
are able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic
classification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the
institutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm
(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role
of improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that
increased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'
improvement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in
practice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'
improvement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's
population plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario
where strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful
users and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.

### [6] [Multidimensional Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09367)
*Rian Neogi,Kanstantsin Pashkovich,Chaitanya Swamy*

Conclusion: 本文首次解决了多维预算可行机制设计的问题，通过新基准和机制设计，为多物品代理场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, a buyer wishes to procure a set of items
of maximum value from self-interested players. We have a valuation function
$v:2^U \to \mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$
specifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current
work on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional
setting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost
$c_e$ for supplying item $e$.
  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe
$U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\{G_i\}$ held by the different players,
and each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set
$S_i\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is
truthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given
budget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a
set of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for
multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result
showing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible
mechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no
budget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We
identify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a
monopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good
guarantees. Second, we devise an alternate benchmark, $OPT_{Bench}$, that
allows for meaningful approximation guarantees, thereby yielding a metric for
comparing mechanisms. Third, we devise budget-feasible mechanisms that achieve
constant-factor approximation guarantees with respect to this benchmark for XOS
valuations.

behavior of project proposers in participatory budgeting (and multiwinner
elections). Here, each proposer submits a subset of project proposals, aiming
at maximizing the total cost of those that get funded. We focus on finding
conditions under which pure Nash equilibria (NE) exist in our games, and on the
complexity of checking whether they exist. We also seek algorithms for
computing best responses for the proposers

### [8] [The Price of EF1 for Few Agents with Additive Ternary Valuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09869)
*Maria Kyropoulou,Alexandros A. Voudouris*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了具有加法三值评估的资源分配问题，针对不可分割物品的EF1分配价格进行了下界分析。对于大量代理（n），EF1价格的下界为Ω(√n)，而对于少量代理（n=2或n=3），价格范围更加精确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究资源分配问题中EF1分配的价格下界，尤其是在代理具有加法三值评估的情况下，目的是比较EF1分配在不同代理数量和评估类型下的性能差异。

Method: 通过理论分析和数学证明，分别针对大量代理和少量代理（n=2或n=3）的情况，计算EF1分配的价格下界。

Result: 对于大量代理（n），EF1价格的下界为Ω(√n)；对于n=2代理，EF1价格为12/11；对于n=3代理，价格介于1.2和1.256之间。

Conclusion: EF1分配的价格在代理数量较多时表现不佳（与一般子加法评估相比），但在代理数量较少时表现更为精确。

Abstract: We consider a resource allocation problem with agents that have additive
ternary valuations for a set of indivisible items, and bound the price of
envy-free up to one item (EF1) allocations. For a large number $n$ of agents,
we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, implying that the price of EF1 is
no better than when the agents have general subadditive valuations. We then
focus on instances with few agents and show that the price of EF1 is $12/11$
for $n=2$, and between $1.2$ and $1.256$ for $n=3$.
