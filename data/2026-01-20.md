Conclusion: zonotopes是一种有效的抽象域，能够生成有界内存的监控器，为实时监控提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Stream-based monitoring assesses the health of safety-critical systems by transforming input streams of sensor measurements into output streams that determine a verdict. These inputs are often treated as accurate representations of the physical state, although real sensors introduce calibration and measurement errors. Such errors propagate through the monitor's computations and can distort the final verdict. Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.
  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications. We demonstrate that zonotopes precisely capture the affine state of the monitor and that their over-approximation produces a sound bounded-memory monitor. We present a comparison of different zonotope over-approximation strategies in the context of runtime monitoring, evaluating their performance and false-positive rates.

TL;DR: Qihe 是第一个针对 Verilog 的通用静态分析框架，填补了硬件领域缺乏类似软件的静态分析工具的空白，支持多种基础分析，并在真实项目中发现了多个未知错误和安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件领域缺乏类似于软件的通用静态分析框架，限制了复杂静态分析的应用潜力。Qihe 的推出旨在解决这一问题，推动硬件静态分析的发展。

Method: Qihe 引入了面向分析的前端、Verilog 特定的中间表示（IR）以及一系列基础分析工具，如位向量算术、寄存器同步和数字组件并发分析，支持复杂的硬件数据和控制流分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，Qihe 在真实硬件项目中发现了 9 个未知错误、18 个现有工具无法检测的错误，以及 16 个安全漏洞。这些结果均得到了开发者的确认。

Conclusion: Qihe 的成功验证了通用硬件静态分析框架的潜力，开源后有望推动硬件静态分析领域的创新和生态系统发展，类似于软件分析领域的繁荣。

Abstract: In the past decades, static analysis has thrived in software, facilitating applications in bug detection, security, and program understanding. These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.

*Naoyuki Kamiyama*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多项式时间算法，用于检查在偏好可能包含平局的情况下，是否存在满足非均匀稳定性的公共独立集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稳定匹配问题的拟阵推广，特别是在偏好可能包含平局的情况下，探索更一般的稳定性条件。

Method: 提出了一种多项式时间算法，用于解决非均匀稳定性的公共独立集存在性检查问题。

Result: 算法能够在多项式时间内验证是否存在满足条件的公共独立集，扩展了超级稳定性和强稳定性的概念。

Conclusion: 该方法为非均匀稳定性条件下的匹配问题提供了有效的解决方案，进一步推广了稳定匹配问题的理论框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a matroid generalization of the stable matching problem. In particular, we consider the setting where preferences may contain ties. For this generalization, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of checking the existence of a common independent set satisfying non-uniform stability, which is a common generalization of super-stability and strong stability.

### [4] [Institutional AI: Governing LLM Collusion in Multi-Agent Cournot Markets via Public Governance Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11369)
*Marcantonio Bracale Syrnikov,Federico Pierucci,Marcello Galisai,Matteo Prandi,Piercosma Bisconti,Francesco Giarrusso,Olga Sorokoletova,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 多智能体大语言模型集合可能收敛于协调且有害的社会均衡。本文提出了一种评估机构AI的实验框架，通过机制设计而非偏好工程来解决对齐问题，其中治理图和运行时系统是关键。实验结果显示，基于治理图的机构AI显著减少了合谋行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体大语言模型在协调行为中可能导致的负面社会影响，并提出一种系统级解决方法，即机构AI，以机制设计为核心重构对齐问题。

Method: 提出治理图作为公开且不可变的声明，定义合法状态、转换、制裁和恢复路径，并由Oracle/Controller运行时系统强制执行。通过实验比较了三种治理机制：无治理（基线）、宪法（仅提示形式）和机构（基于治理图）。

Result: 基于治理图的机构机制显著减少了合谋行为：平均层级从3.1降至1.8，严重合谋发生率从50%降至5.6%。仅提示形式的宪法机制无明显改进。

Conclusion: 多智能体对齐问题可以视为机构设计问题，治理图为对齐相关的集体行为提供了可行的抽象方法。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.

### [5] [Minimizing the Cost of EFx Allocations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11372)
*Eva Deltl*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了minCost-EFx分配问题，旨在计算既满足EFx公平性又具有最小成本的资源分配方案，并分析了其算法复杂性和可解决性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源分配中，如何在保证公平性的同时限制成本是一个重要挑战。现有研究大多关注成本最小化或公平性，而忽略了两者的结合。

Method: 引入并形式化定义了minCost-EFx分配问题，研究了其算法复杂性，证明其在两个代理下已为NP难问题，同时探索了多项式核的存在性及参数受限的可处理性。

Result: 研究表明，问题在多项式时间内不可近似（除非P=NP），但在特定受限成本模型下有更好的近似保证。

Conclusion: 核心复杂性源于物品数量，但通过参数受限或特定成本模型，部分情况可高效解决或近似。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness while limiting costs, such as transportation or storage, is an important challenge in resource allocation, yet most work has focused on cost minimization without fairness or fairness without explicit cost considerations. We introduce and formally define the minCost-EFx Allocation problem, where the objective is to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to any item (EFx) and has minimum cost. We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $ρ>1$ the problem is not $ρ$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.

### [6] [New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414)
*Shaohua Yu,Wenhao Mao,Zigao Wu,Jakob Puchinger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新型自适应机制DAC-ALNS，通过Dual Actor-Critic模型增强ALNS算法的适应性，充分考虑破坏与修复操作之间的交互作用，显著提升算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ALNS自适应机制未考虑破坏与修复操作间交互作用的选择问题，限制了算法性能，本研究旨在克服这一局限性。

Method: 采用Dual Actor-Critic模型，将破坏与修复过程建模为独立马尔可夫决策过程，并使用图神经网络提取问题实例的关键特征。

Result: 实验表明DAC-ALNS算法显著提升了解题效率，并表现出优秀的可迁移性。

Conclusion: DAC-ALNS通过结合DAC模型和图神经网络，有效提升了ALNS算法的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.

### [7] [The Poisoned Apple Effect: Strategic Manipulation of Mediated Markets via Technology Expansion of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11496)
*Eilam Shapira,Roi Reichart,Moshe Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究表明，AI代理在经济市场中的集成会显著改变战略互动的格局，尤其是在议价、谈判和说服等经典博弈论场景中。增加AI代理的选择可能会大幅改变均衡收益和监管结果，但也可能导致“毒苹果”效应的战略现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI技术在经典博弈论场景（如议价、谈判和说服）中的经济影响，以及其对均衡结果和监管框架的潜在改变。

Method: 通过三个经典博弈论场景（资源分配、不对称信息交易和战略信息传递）来分析AI技术扩展的经济影响。

Result: 研究发现，增加AI代理的选择会显著改变均衡收益和监管结果，同时也揭示了“毒苹果”效应——即通过战略性地发布技术来操控监管设计。

Conclusion: 静态监管框架易受技术扩展的操控，因此需要动态的市场设计以适应AI能力的不断演变。

Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.
