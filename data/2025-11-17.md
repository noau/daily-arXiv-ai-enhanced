### [1] [Data Race Detection by Digest-Driven Abstract Interpretation (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11055)
*Michael Schwarz,Julian Erhard*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于摘要（digests）的静态分析方法，用于证明数据竞争的缺失。通过将摘要概念扩展到竞争检测，并结合线程模块化局部跟踪语义，显著提高了正确解决任务的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态分析可以证明数据竞争的缺失，但现有方法在并发敏感性和准确性上存在局限。论文旨在通过重新利用摘要概念，开发一种更有效的竞争检测方法。

Method: 论文将摘要概念应用于竞争检测，定义了线程模块化局部跟踪语义中的数据竞争，并将潜在冲突的排除条件表示为摘要。在静态分析器Goblint中实现了摘要驱动的竞争检测。

Result: 在SV-COMP基准测试中，结合锁集摘要与线程ID和线程连接的摘要，正确解决的任务数量比单独使用锁集推理提高了五倍以上。

Conclusion: 通过扩展摘要概念并将其应用于竞争检测，论文展示了该方法在静态分析中的有效性，显著提升了数据竞争检测的准确性和覆盖率。

Abstract: Sound static analysis can prove the absence of data races by establishing that no two conflicting memory accesses can occur at the same time. We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率推理在处理大数据集或长随机样本序列时成本高昂，现有自动矢量化技术无法处理通用重复结构。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多种概率模型上实现了1.1-6倍的性能提升，并减少了GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法在处理所有测试模型时均有效，表现优于现有基线。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a popular tool for high-level modelling across many fields. They provide a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference, which analyse models by learning their parameters from a dataset or estimating their posterior distributions. However, probabilistic inference is known to be very costly. One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic inference stems from the iteration over entries of a large dataset or a long series of random samples. Vectorisation can mitigate this cost, but manual vectorisation is error-prone, and existing automatic techniques are often ad-hoc and limited, unable to handle general repetition structures, such as nested loops and loops with data-dependent control flow, without significant user intervention. To address this bottleneck, we propose a sound and effective method for automatically vectorising loops in probabilistic programs. Our method achieves high throughput using speculative parallel execution of loop iterations, while preserving the semantics of the original loop through a fixed-point check. We formalise our method as a translation from an imperative PPL into a lower-level target language with primitives geared towards vectorisation. We implemented our method for the Pyro PPL and evaluated it on a range of probabilistic models. Our experiments show significant performance gains against an existing vectorisation baseline, achieving $1.1$--$6\times$ speedups and reducing GPU memory usage in many cases. Unlike the baseline, which is limited to a subset of models, our method effectively handled all the tested models.

Abstract: This booklet serves as an introduction to Kleene Algebra (KA), a set of laws that can be used to study general equivalences between programs. It discusses how general programs can be modeled using regular expressions, how those expressions correspond to automata, and how this correspondence can be exploited to obtain the central result of KA, namely that an equivalence of regular expressions is true if and only if it can be proved using the laws of KA. Each chapter closes with a set of exercises to further build intuition and understanding, and there is an optional chapter that develops automata theory through the lens of coalgebra.

### [4] [The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292)

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Jasmin框架是一个用于开发高效、形式化验证的密码学实现的编程和验证框架。本文通过增强Jasmin编译器的前端功能，证明了其在非终止和概率计算中保留密码学安全性。

Conclusion: 本文通过新定义的关系Hoare逻辑和交互树语义，显著增强了Jasmin编译器的安全性保证，适用于密码学实现中的非终止和概率计算。

Abstract: Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography.
  In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.

### [5] [Online Price Competition under Generalized Linear Demands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10718)
*Daniele Bracale,Moulinath Banerjee,Cong Shi,Yuekai Sun*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究多卖家竞争环境中的价格动态,提出了一种新的分散策略PML-GLUCB,无需协调探索阶段即可有效估计需求参数,并达到接近最优的遗憾率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于线性需求模型,而现实中需求往往更为复杂。本文旨在扩展至更广泛的单指数需求模型,解决多卖家竞争环境中的参数估计与价格优化问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合惩罚最大似然估计(MLE)和上置信定价规则的分散策略PML-GLUCB,适用于二元和实值需求观测,无需卖家之间的协调探索。

Result: 相对于动态基准策略,每个卖家的遗憾率为O(N²√T log(T)),接近线性环境中的已知最优率。

Conclusion: PML-GLUCB策略在多卖家竞争环境中表现优异,技术贡献在于将椭圆势引理扩展至多智能体系统,为复杂需求模型提供了有效的分散解决方案。

Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $λ_i(\mathbf{p}) = μ_i(\langle \boldsymbolθ_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $μ_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbolθ_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了自私代理在网络互联和安全决策中的行为，改进了Goyal等人的博弈论模型，证明了自私代理构建的网络能够抵抗大部分潜在攻击者，并解决了开放性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通信网络是现代经济和生活的关键组成部分，但也成为攻击者的目标。由于网络由多个自私代理分散管理和互联，研究这些代理如何决策互联和安全策略具有重要意义。

Method: 论文基于Goyal等人的博弈论模型，分析了自私代理在网络互联和安全决策中的行为，并通过理论推导改进了模型的边界条件。

Result: 研究发现，自私代理构建的网络能够抵抗大量潜在攻击者，并在攻击后保持渐进最优的福利水平。此外，攻击者试图最小化社会福利的行为并未造成最大可能的损害。

Conclusion: 论文表明，自私代理的网络决策在攻击下具有显著的鲁棒性，解决了开放性问题并为未来的网络安全研究提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.
  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.

### [7] [Playing with Peaks: A Game-Theoretic Comparison of Electricity Pricing Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10854)
*Vade Shah,Jason R. Marden*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种广泛实施的电力定价机制：任意峰时定价（AP）和同时峰时定价（CP），发现CP在完全信息下的均衡峰值需求不超过AP，但在不完全信息下可能导致更大的峰值需求。

Motivation: 随着电力消费的增长，降低峰值需求对防止基础设施过载和停电至关重要。研究旨在比较两种定价机制的实际效果。

Method: 通过将电力市场建模为战略博弈，研究在AP和CP机制下的均衡峰值需求。

Result: 完全信息下，CP的均衡峰值需求不超过AP；但不完全信息下，CP可能因协调不当导致更大的峰值需求。

Conclusion: 研究建议采用渐进式需求成本结构以平衡协调收益和风险，适用于确定性和随机性情景。

Abstract: As electricity consumption grows, reducing peak demand--the maximum load on the grid--has become critical for preventing infrastructure strain and blackouts. Pricing mechanisms that incentivize consumers with flexible loads to shift consumption away from high-demand periods have emerged as effective tools, yet different mechanisms are used in practice with unclear relative performance. This work compares two widely implemented approaches: anytime peak pricing (AP), where consumers pay for their individual maximum consumption, and coincident peak pricing (CP), where consumers pay for their consumption during the system-wide peak period. To compare these mechanisms, we model the electricity market as a strategic game and characterize the peak demand in equilibrium under both AP and CP. Our main result demonstrates that with perfect information, equilibrium peak demand under CP never exceeds that under AP; on the other hand, with imperfect information, the coordination introduced by CP can backfire and induce larger equilibrium peaks than AP. These findings demonstrate that potential gains from coupling users' costs (as done in CP) must be weighed against these miscoordination risks. We conclude with preliminary results indicating that progressive demand cost structures--rather than per-unit charges--may mitigate these risks while preserving coordination benefits, achieving desirable performance in both deterministic and stochastic settings.

### [8] [Fair Incentives for Early Arrival in 0-1 Cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11023)
*Yaoxin Ge,Yao Zhang,Dengji Zhao*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的公平性机制（Egalitarian Value-Sharing, EVS），用于在线合作游戏中，旨在最小化每个到达顺序中价值分配与Shapley值之间的距离，并最大化贡献玩家的平等福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线合作游戏中，早期的解决方案忽略了每个到达顺序中的公平性，导致重要玩家可能在游戏中一无所获，这种不公平现象激发了本文的研究动机。

Method: 本文提出了EVS机制，通过计算每个到达顺序中价值分配与Shapley值之间的距离，并试图最小化这一距离，从而改进公平性。

Result: 结果表明，EVS机制能够最大化所有贡献玩家的平等福利，并在0-1价值游戏中实现更公平的价值分配。

Conclusion: 本文通过EVS机制解决了在线合作游戏中的公平性问题，为重要玩家提供了更合理的价值分配，并在理论上证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Incentives for early arrival (I4EA) was recently proposed for studying online cooperative games. In an online cooperative game, players arrive in an unknown order, and the value increase after each player arrived should be distributed immediately among all the arrived players. Although there is only one arriving order in the game, we also hope that the value distribution is equal to their Shapley value in expectation. To achieve these goals, the early solutions ignored the fairness in each single arriving order. More specifically, an important player may receive nothing in a game, which seems unfair in reality. To combat this, we propose refined fairness in this paper and design new solutions in 0-1 value games. Specifically, we compute the distance of the distribution in each order to the Shapley value and aim to minimize it. We propose a new mechanism called Egalitarian Value-Sharing (EVS) to do so. We also show that the mechanism can maximize the egalitarian welfare among all the players who made contributions.

### [9] [ε-Optimally Solving Two-Player Zero-Sum POSGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11282)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的框架，用于ε-最优解决双人零和部分可观察随机博弈（zs-POSGs），通过无损失约简将其转化为过渡无关的zs-SGs，并展示了PBVI算法在多个基准领域的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该结果开辟了将随机博弈的理论和算法系统性迁移到部分可观察环境的途径。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for ε-optimally solving two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (zs-POSGs). These games pose a major challenge due to the absence of a principled connection with dynamic programming (DP) techniques developed for two-player zero-sum stochastic games (zs-SGs). Prior attempts at transferring solution methods have lacked a lossless reduction, defined here as a transformation that preserves value functions, equilibrium strategies, and optimality structure, thereby limiting generalisation to ad-hoc algorithms. This work introduces the first lossless reduction from zs-POSGs to transition-independent zs-SGs, enabling the principled application of a broad class of DP-based methods. We show empirically that point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithms, applied via this reduction, produce ε-optimal strategies across a range of benchmark domains, consistently matching or outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results open a systematic pathway for algorithmic and theoretical transfer from SGs to partially observable settings.

Motivation: 探讨政党在多数选举中如何策略性地提名候选人，以及在特定选民偏好条件下的选举结果和纳什均衡问题。

Method: 引入“党派对齐单峰性”偏好限制，开发多项式时间算法识别这种偏好，并分析提名策略对选举结果的影响。

Result: 提供了多项式时间算法识别“党派对齐单峰性”，证明了在三党选举中纯策略纳什均衡的存在性。

Conclusion: 在特定偏好条件下，政党提名策略可以影响选举结果，且在三党选举中存在纯策略纳什均衡。

Abstract: We study strategic candidate nomination by parties in elections decided by Plurality voting. Each party selects a nominee before the election, and the winner is chosen from the nominated candidates based on the voters' preferences. We introduce a new restriction on these preferences, which we call party-aligned single-peakedness: all voters agree on a common ordering of the parties along an ideological axis, but may differ in their perceptions of the positions of individual candidates within each party. The preferences of each voter are single-peaked with respect to their own axis over the candidates, which is consistent with the global ordering of the parties. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a preference profile satisfies party-aligned single-peakedness. In this domain, we give polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether a given party can become the winner under some (or all) nominations, and whether this can occur in some pure Nash equilibrium. We also prove a tight result about the guaranteed existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria for elections with up to three parties for single-peaked and party-aligned single-peaked preference profiles.

Conclusion: 快乐核仁在理论和实际应用中均表现出复杂性和潜力，未来的研究可进一步优化其计算方法。

Abstract: We study the recently introduced fair division concept of the happy nucleolus for cost allocation among players in a cooperative game, with special focus on its computation. The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value. Still, we show that the relation between the two concepts is quite involved, and intuitive properties do not hold - e.g., the entry of a player in the happy nucleolus can be larger than the entry of the same player in the nucleolus, even for monotone and subadditive games. This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).
  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to Köhnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.
  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.

### [12] [Public Goods Games in Directed Networks with Constraints on Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11475)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 在公共物品博弈中，玩家决定是否购买一种不可分割的物品，该物品将被其特定的邻居使用，且存在容量限制。研究探讨了纯策略和混合策略纳什均衡的存在性、计算和效率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨在有向图中，玩家在容量限制下如何做出购买和分享决策，以及这些决策对博弈均衡的影响。

Method: 研究方法包括分析纯策略和混合策略纳什均衡的存在性、计算复杂性以及对网络结构和分享容量的依赖性。

Result: 结果表明，针对不同的网络结构和容量参数，存在清晰的复杂性二分法，为均衡的计算和效率提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，网络结构和容量限制对博弈的结果具有显著影响，并为相关优化问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In a public goods game, every player chooses whether or not to buy a good that all neighboring players will have access to. We consider a setting in which the good is indivisible, neighboring players are out-neighbors in a directed graph, and there is a capacity constraint on their number, k, that can benefit from the good. This means that each player makes a two-pronged decision: decide whether or not to buy and, conditional on buying, choose which k out-neighbors to share access. We examine both pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the model from the perspective of existence, computation, and efficiency. We perform a comprehensive study for these three dimensions with respect to both sharing capacity (k) and the network structure (the underlying directed graph), and establish sharp complexity dichotomies for each.

Result: 研究结果表明，对于加法可分、分数和修正分数享乐游戏（ASHGs、FHGs、MFHGs），存在基于单智能体偏离的所有合理稳定性概念的硬性问题。同时，发现CIS动态从单例分区可能在线性次偏离后收敛，但在最坏情况下可能需要指数次偏离。

Conclusion: 论文证明了基数享乐游戏中动态模型的硬性问题，并提出了一种寻找CIS分区的方法，为相关领域的研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Computing stable partitions in hedonic games is a challenging task because there exist games in which stable outcomes do not exist. Even more, these No-instances can often be leveraged to prove computational hardness results. We make this impression rigorous in a dynamic model of cardinal hedonic games by providing meta theorems. These imply hardness of deciding about the possible or necessary convergence of deviation dynamics based on the mere existence of No-instances. Our results hold for additively separable, fractional, and modified fractional hedonic games (ASHGs, FHGs, and MFHGs). Moreover, they encompass essentially all reasonable stability notions based on single-agent deviations. In addition, we propose dynamics as a method to find individually rational and contractually individual stable (CIS) partitions in ASHGs. In particular, we find that CIS dynamics from the singleton partition possibly converge after a linear number of deviations but may require an exponential number of deviations in the worst case.

Abstract: We address the synthesis of control policies for unknown discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems to satisfy temporal logic objectives. We present a data-driven, abstraction-based control framework that integrates online learning with novel incremental game-solving. Under appropriate continuity assumptions, our method abstracts the system dynamics into a finite stochastic (2.5-player) game graph derived from data. Given a requirement over time on this graph, we compute the winning region -- i.e., the set of initial states from which the objective is satisfiable -- in the resulting game, together with a corresponding control policy.
  Our main contribution is the construction of abstractions, winning regions and control policies incrementally, as data about the system dynamics accumulates. Concretely, our algorithm refines under- and over-approximations of reachable sets for each state-action pair as new data samples arrive. These refinements induce structural modifications in the game graph abstraction -- such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges -- which in turn modify the winning region. Crucially, we show that these updates are inherently monotonic: under-approximations can only grow, over-approximations can only shrink, and the winning region can only expand.
  We exploit this monotonicity by defining an objective-induced ranking function on the nodes of the abstract game that increases monotonically as new data samples are incorporated. These ranks underpin our novel incremental game-solving algorithm, which employs customized gadgets (DAG-like subgames) within a rank-lifting algorithm to efficiently update the winning region. Numerical case studies demonstrate significant computational savings compared to the baseline approach, which resolves the entire game from scratch whenever new data samples arrive.
