Despite the scale of perpetual futures markets, ADL has received limited formal treatment as a sequential control problem. This paper provides a concise formalization of ADL as online learning on a PNL-haircut domain: at each round, the venue selects a solvency budget and a set of profitable trader accounts. The profitable accounts are liquidated to cover shortfalls up to the solvency budget, with the aim of recovering exchange-wide solvency. In this model, ADL haircuts apply to positive PNL (unrealized gains), not to posted collateral principal. Using our online learning model, we provide robustness results and theoretical upper bounds on how poorly a mechanism can perform at recovering solvency. We apply our model to the October 10, 2025 Hyperliquid stress episode. The regret caused by Hyperliquid's production ADL queue is about 50\\% of an upper bound on regret, calibrated to this event, while our optimized algorithm achieves about 2.6\\% of the same bound. In dollar terms, the production ADL model over liquidates trader profits by up to \\$51.7M. We also counterfactually evaluated algorithms inspired by our online learning framework that perform better and found that the best algorithm reduces overshoot to \\$3M. Our results provide simple, implementable mechanisms for improving ADL in live perpetuals exchanges."}

The interest rate offered by each borrowing bank is within the interest rate corridor set by the central bank and ultimately depends on the demand and the supply of cash in the interbank market. Lending banks naturally aim to maximise the income coming from the interest repayments. In its purest form, this is an infinite-strategy game that we show to be an exact potential game which has a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We then define and solve a constrained optimisation problem and propose a strongly polynomial-time algorithm to compute this Nash equilibrium. We also study some variants of best-response dynamics of this lending game, showing that they converge to the Nash equilibrium in both discrete and continuous-time scenarios."}

Given a probability distribution $Q$ over a set of targets $\\mathcal{Y}$, the $n$ players each choose a position in a space $\\mathcal{X}$. A player's utility is the $Q$-mass of targets they are closest to under some proximity measure, with ties broken evenly. Our model captures Hotelling games and forecasting competitions, among other applications. We show that for sufficiently large $n$, both pure and symmetric mixed Nash equilibria exist, and moreover are extreme: all players play on a finite set of pseudo-targets $\\mathcal{X}^* \\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$. We further show that both pure and symmetric mixed equilibria converge to the distribution $P$ on $\\mathcal{X}^*$ induced by $Q$, and bound the convergence rate in $n$. The generality of our model allows us to extend and strengthen previous work in Hotelling games, and prove entirely new results in forecasting competitions and other applications."}

Appendices: 19 pages. To appear in proceedings of 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)", "summary": "Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium for imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs) that enforces consistency between the two components of a solution: agents' strategy profile describing their decisions at information sets and the belief system quantifying their uncertainty over histories within an information set. We present a scalable approach for computing a PBE of an arbitrary two-player EFG. We adopt the definition of PBE enunciated by Bonanno in 2011 using a consistency concept based on the theory of belief revision due to Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson. Our algorithm for finding a PBE is an adaptation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that minimizes the expected regret at each information set given a belief system, while maintaining the necessary consistency criteria. We prove that our algorithm is correct for two-player zero-sum games and has a reasonable slowdown in time-complexity relative to classical CFR given the additional computation needed for refinement. We also experimentally demonstrate the competent performance of PBE-CFR in terms of equilibrium quality and running time on medium-to-large non-zero-sum EFGs. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of using PBE for strategy exploration in empirical game-theoretic analysis. Specifically, we compute PBE as a meta-strategy solver (MSS) in a tree-exploiting variant of Policy Space Response Oracles (TE-PSRO). Our experiments show that PBE as an MSS leads to higher-quality empirical EFG models with complex imperfect information structures compared to MSSs based on an unrefined Nash equilibrium."}

However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time."}

They encompass games such as the ``absentminded driver'' and team games with limited communication. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark suite for imperfect-recall decision problems. Our benchmarks capture a variety of problem types, including ones concerning privacy in AI systems that elicit sensitive information, and AI safety via testing of agents in simulation. Across 61 problem instances generated using this suite, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms for finding first-order optimal strategies in such problems. In particular, we introduce the family of regret matching (RM) algorithms for nonlinear constrained optimization. This class of parameter-free algorithms has enjoyed tremendous success in solving large two-player zero-sum games, but, surprisingly, they were hitherto relatively unexplored beyond that setting. Our key finding is that RM algorithms consistently outperform commonly employed first-order optimizers such as projected gradient descent, often by orders of magnitude. This establishes, for the first time, the RM family as a formidable approach to large-scale constrained optimization problems."}

The fair division literature has traditionally focused on two broad classes of fairness notions: envy-based notions and share-based notions. Within the share-based framework, most attention has been devoted to the maximin share (MMS) guarantee and its relaxations, while envy-based fairness has primarily centered on EFX and its relaxations. Recent work has shown the existence of allocations that simultaneously satisfy multiplicative approximate MMS and envy-based guarantees such as EF1 or EFX.\n  Motivated by this line of research, we study for the first time the compatibility between ordinal approximations of MMS and envy-based fairness notions. In particular, we establish the existence of allocations satisfying the following combined guarantees: (i) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\\lceil 3n/2 \\rceil$ MMS and EFX for ordered instances; (ii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\\lceil 3n/2 \\rceil$ MMS and EF1 for top-$n$ instances; and (iii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$4\\lceil n/3 \\rceil$ MMS and EF1 for ordered instances."}

Here, we are given a graph, called a topology, and a set of agents that need to be allocated to its vertices. Moreover, every agent has an ideal (and possibly different) distance in which to be from some of the other agents. Given an allocation of agents, each one of them suffers a cost that is the sum of the differences from the ideal distance for each agent in their subset. The goal is to decide whether there is a stable allocation of the agents, i.e., no agent would like to deviate from their location. Specifically, we consider three different stability notions: envy-freeness, swap stability, and jump stability. We perform a comprehensive study of the (parameterized) complexity of the problem in three different dimensions: the topology of the graph, the number of agents, and the structure of preferences of the agents."}
