### [1] [DogFit: Domain-guided Fine-tuning for Efficient Transfer Learning of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05685)
*Yara Bahram,Mohammadhadi Shateri,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit)方法，通过将领域感知引导偏移注入训练损失，实现在扩散迁移学习中高效可控的保真度-多样性权衡，无需额外计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散模型迁移学习到较小目标域时，直接微调常导致泛化性能差。现有测试时引导方法虽可提升图像保真度，但计算成本高且需双重前向传播。

Method: DogFit方法通过在训练损失中注入领域感知引导偏移，将引导行为内化到微调过程中，并通过轻量级条件机制编码引导强度值以支持推理时的可控权衡。

Result: 实验表明，DogFit在六个不同目标域上优于现有引导方法，FID和FDDINOV2指标表现更优，且采样计算量减少多达2倍。

Conclusion: DogFit通过在训练中内化引导行为并结合调度策略，实现了高效可控的迁移学习，为扩散模型的适应性优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is
challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor
generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering
controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample
diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically
requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided
Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion
transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional
computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the
training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the
fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation
that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger
marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable
fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength
value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning
mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the
guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,
i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training
stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target
domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer
learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling
TFLOPS.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments
via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based
displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To
develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change
characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional
methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or
viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has
begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues
as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an
interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on
real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's
accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints
and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results
indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics
similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more
quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.

Conclusion: 论文通过子值图和dGL，为混合游戏提供了灵活且安全的非确定性策略合成框架，为嵌入式系统的控制问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Control problems for embedded systems like cars and trains can be modeled by
two-player hybrid games. Control envelopes, which are families of safe control
solutions, correspond to nondeterministic winning policies of hybrid games,
where each deterministic specialization of the policy is a control solution.
This paper synthesizes nondeterministic winning policies for hybrid games that
are as permissive as possible. It introduces subvalue maps, a compositional
representation of such policies that enables verification and synthesis along
the structure of the game. An inductive logical characterization in
differential game logic (dGL) checks whether a subvalue map induces a sound
control envelope which always induces a winning play. A policy is said to win
if it always achieves the desirable outcome when the player follows it, no
matter what actions the opponent plays. The maximal subvalue map, which allows
the most action options while still winning, is shown to exist and satisfy a
logical characterization. A family of algorithms for nondeterministic policy
synthesis can be obtained from the inductive subvalue map soundness
characterization. An implementation of these findings is evaluated on examples
that use the expressivity of dGL to model a range of diverse control
challenges.

Method: 提出了一种随机多臂老虎机模型，其中臂代表预算分配的比例，并通过设计算法优化预期遗憾。

Result: 算法在总步数为 $T$ 时的预期遗憾为 $K\sqrt{T}$（对数因子内），在满足递减回报条件时改进为 $K (\log T)^2$。

Conclusion: 研究证明了算法在预算分配问题中的有效性，并在特定条件下进一步优化了遗憾边界。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in crowdsourcing, where a fixed sum of money is
split among $K$ workers, and autobidding, where a fixed budget is used to bid
in $K$ simultaneous auctions, we define a stochastic bandit model where arms
belong to the $K$-dimensional probability simplex and represent the fraction of
budget allocated to each task/auction. The reward in each round is the sum of
$K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a
probability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that
task/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is
of order $K\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound.
Improved bounds of order $K (\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping
budget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or
winning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that enhances the
efficiency of mobile blockchain networks, by enabling miners, often acted by
mobile users (MUs) with limited computing resources, to offload
resource-intensive mining tasks to nearby edge computing servers. Collaborative
block mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to
form coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data
together to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted
collaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both
technologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for
blockchain systems. While existing research in this area has mainly focused on
the single-coalition collaboration mode, where each miner can only join one
coalition, this work explores a more comprehensive multi-coalition
collaboration mode, which allows each miner to join multiple coalitions. To
analyze the behavior of miners and the edge computing service provider (ECP) in
this scenario, we propose a novel two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the
ECP, as the leader, determines the prices of computing resources for all MUs.
In Stage II, each MU decides the coalitions to join, resulting in an
overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game; Subsequently, each coalition
decides how many edge computing resources to purchase from the ECP, leading to
an edge resource competition (ERC) game. We derive the closed-form Nash
equilibrium for the ERC game, based on which we further propose an OCF-based
alternating algorithm to achieve a stable coalition structure for the OCF game
and develop a near-optimal pricing strategy for the ECP's resource pricing
problem.

Abstract: The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources
yields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing
supply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due
to capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned
batteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation
potential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the
decision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice
by each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an
analysis from a game-theoretic point of view.
  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic
setting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries
to increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market
model where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize
renewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we
study the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing
strategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the
chosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls
for more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich
field for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable
energy networks.
